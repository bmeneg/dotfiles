-------------------------
Manual configurations:

- SSH key from GPG key:
	Setup previously created GPG private/public key as SSH authentication key:
	$ cat << EOF >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf # create the file if needed
		default-cache-ttl 7200
		default-cache-ttl-ssh 7200
		enable-ssh-support
		EOF
	$ cat << EOF >> ~/.bash_profile
		unset SSH_AGENT_PID
		if [ "${gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by:-0}" -ne $$ ]; then
			export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)"
			gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
		fi
		EOF
	$ gpgconf --kill gpg-agent  # just in case it's already running
	$ source ~/.bash_profile
	$ gpg -k --with-keygrip

	copy the keygrip of the Authentication subkey ([*A]) and:

	$ echo "<keygrip>" > ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol

	check if the key was properly added:

	$ ssh-add -l

	In this way there is no need of ~/.ssh/id_rsa file to git/ssh/... authenticate.

	Note: the default GnuPG pinentry program conflicts somehow with tmux, so
	you might see issues during the ssh key usage. Install pinentry-gtk or -qt
	to workaround it (or stop using tmux).

- Setup MIT Kerberos on Windows:
	Download the client for windows: https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/
    
	Check if the cache env variable was created:
		PS> $Env:KRB5CCNAME
		C:\ProgramData\MIT\Kerberos5\krb5cache
	otherwise create it yourself.

	Add all krb5 configuration to C:\ProgramData\MIT\Kerberos5\krb5.ini.
	Note: it can be copied from the Linux one (in /etc/krb5.conf), you only
	need to change the file extension from .conf to .ini.

	Now, to get Firefox working with SSO through GSSAPI:
		Open about:config page
		Set 'network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris' to the desired domain
		Set 'network.auth.use-sspi' to 'false' (forcing GSSAPI usage)
	Some optional changes are:
		Set 'network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris' to the same domain
		Set 'network.negotiate-auth.using-native-gsslib' to 'false'
		Set 'network.negotiate-auth.gsslib' to 'C:\Program Files\MIT\Kerberos\bin\gssapi64.dll'

		And you are done.
