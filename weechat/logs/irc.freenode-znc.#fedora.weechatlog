2017-07-03 13:55:40	Khaytsus	tcpdump: Nuke or truncate?  man journalctl
2017-07-03 13:55:45	Khaytsus	tcpdump: Look for vacuum
2017-07-03 13:56:04	Drakonis	ubuntu lags behind due to it rebasing on debian releases
2017-07-03 13:56:04	tcpdump	Khaytsus: get rid of = I did vaccuum, everyhing older than 1 second.
2017-07-03 13:56:11	tcpdump	Didnt seem to owrk.
2017-07-03 13:56:13	tcpdump	*work
2017-07-03 13:56:27	Drakonis	wine on 17.04 is at least a year and half old
2017-07-03 13:56:29	brunch	yeah, I could see that on f26. I did want to give rawhide a go, though. Gnome got some new fancy animations and it didn't break so I stayed.
2017-07-03 13:56:54	Drakonis	gnome releases in lockstep with fedora
2017-07-03 13:57:07	brunch	but now the nvidia driver is giving trouble again and it's an opportunity to learn
2017-07-03 13:57:24	Drakonis	much like the grand scourge of computer software, systemd, releases in lockstep with the linux kernel
2017-07-03 13:57:25	brunch	I'm just having trouble finding docs for it
2017-07-03 13:57:27	Drakonis	learn~~
2017-07-03 13:57:35	Drakonis	i think people use that word incorrectly
2017-07-03 13:57:50	Drakonis	i suppose you learn the distro, not the system
2017-07-03 13:58:20	brunch	Well back in ubuntu I'd circumvent the nvidia issues by winning the race condition and getting in a TTY before the system froze
2017-07-03 13:58:33	Drakonis	wow uh
2017-07-03 13:58:34	Drakonis	goddamn.
2017-07-03 13:58:45	brunch	but with fedora I learned to boot in vesa and blacklist nouveau from there
2017-07-03 13:58:53	Drakonis	i don't think i ever had issues with nvidia while using ubuntu
2017-07-03 13:59:06	brunch	you wouldn't believe how much a pain in the ass this card is
2017-07-03 13:59:07	Drakonis	all i had to do was toggle the driver and then reboot
2017-07-03 13:59:16	Drakonis	same with fedora
2017-07-03 13:59:34	brunch	well the solution is to install the propietary driver in the end
2017-07-03 13:59:42	brunch	the problem was getting there :Ã¾
2017-07-03 13:59:43	Drakonis	nvidia, yes.
2017-07-03 13:59:50	Drakonis	which card
2017-07-03 13:59:55	brunch	but I've learned my lesson, next time I'll go amd
2017-07-03 13:59:58	Drakonis	hmm
2017-07-03 14:00:00	Drakonis	that depends
2017-07-03 14:00:00	brunch	it's a gtx960m
2017-07-03 14:00:03	brunch	laptop, for the win
2017-07-03 14:00:04	Drakonis	oh hm
2017-07-03 14:00:09	Drakonis	that shouldn't be too bad
2017-07-03 14:00:17	Drakonis	nouveau works well enough for you to get to the desktop
2017-07-03 14:00:18	brunch	well mesa freezes with it
2017-07-03 14:00:27	Drakonis	right, bumblebee was it
2017-07-03 14:00:33	 *	brunch shrugs
2017-07-03 14:00:44	Drakonis	that's a issue that's getting fixed

2017-07-03 14:01:44	Drakonis	mesa's opengl.
2017-07-03 14:02:01	Drakonis	pin number is actually quite accurate :v

2017-07-03 14:03:24	brunch	...so what exactly am I looking for in the xorg log?
2017-07-03 14:03:42	brunch	I see it loads the nvidia module
2017-07-03 14:03:47	brunch	but then loads the nouveau one

2017-07-03 14:11:16	Drakonis	also normally yes its nouveau being a dick
2017-07-03 14:11:22	Drakonis	which is why its disabled
2017-07-03 14:11:37	Drakonis	but there are times where the kernel sees big changes
2017-07-03 14:12:13	Drakonis	but from my experience, normally the kernel devs avoid breaking userspace

2017-07-03 16:53:58	Alsino	negativo17??? Isn't that for spotify?
2017-07-03 16:54:33	taliptako	they normally provide nvidia proprietary drivers and they are compatible with optimus
2017-07-03 16:54:47	taliptako	but when i enable the repo drivers didnt show up on gnome software center
2017-07-03 16:55:01	taliptako	because of this probably
2017-07-03 16:55:01	taliptako	Please note that the driver will show up only if your system matches one of the PCI ID supported by the driver. Otherwise, only the other Nvidia programs (mostly for CUDA development) will show up in the software center.
2017-07-03 16:55:32	taliptako	i was planning to install nvidia drivers from software center but they didnt show up so i came here
2017-07-03 16:56:37	kk4ewt	remove the negativo repos and follow the rpmfusion howto and your will be fine
2017-07-03 16:56:43	drakonis	probably not nvidia drivers though

2017-07-03 17:03:38	taliptako	Gnome with Wayland and NVIDIA doesn't work together at this point. There are probably issues around libglvnd, and mutter might need to enable support for egl-device (which is the NVIDIA API for buffer management as opposed to Mesa GBM).

2017-07-04 09:26:03	DaemonFC	[03:23:57] Just wondering.
2017-07-04 09:26:03	DaemonFC	[03:25:17] Well, I installed the final 4.12 kernel from Koji and I noticed that many of my games went from unplayable under Wayland to silky smooth.
2017-07-04 09:26:03	DaemonFC	[03:25:26] So clearly something got fixed.
2017-07-04 09:26:03	DaemonFC	[03:25:54] I was having to log into GNOME on Xorg to play Borderlands 2, for example.
2017-07-04 09:26:03	DaemonFC	[03:26:24] Under Wayland it was like render something freeze for a few seconds, render, freeze, render a little, chunk chunk chunk.
2017-07-04 09:26:03	DaemonFC	[03:26:41] Now it plays fine.

2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:23:44] hi
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:24:16] any advice for how I would get PHP 7.0 on F26? Remi only has 7.1 and 7.2 and f26 repos only have 7.1
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:24:41] if there is no package, you have to compile it yourself
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:25:22] that seems veeeery troublesome
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:26:06] well, tahts what happens when you want to use old unsupported software
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:27:51] its not particularly old nor unsupported, in fact most sites do not even use 7.x
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:28:16] and its not a matter of me wanting or not wanting to use it, it's a matter of existing codebases requiring it
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:28:53] well, that sounds unfortunate for you
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:29:04] thanks for your completely useless advice
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:29:21] a package doesnt exist
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:29:23] you have to compie it
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:29:25] what more do ou want?
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:31:49] for it to be provided by a repository, duh
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[Enrico]	[06:31:49] Starcraftmazter: if yuo can use fedora 25 instead of 26 you have php 7.0 provided from the official repos
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:32:31] [Enrico]: that sounds really strange though.... this is very commonly used software, how can it be not provided
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:32:50] well fedora has to pick some version
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:32:52] and they pick the latest
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:33:09] yeh that makes sense, im more wondering about remi not having it
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[Enrico]	[06:33:21] Starcraftmazter: commonly is a relative subject. Keep in mind what Fedora goal is. Primarely it's a distro for developers, with a life time for a release of about 1 year
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:33:23] well you should talk to whoever this "remi" character is
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:33:32] whatever it is, its not supportd here
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:33:39] well maybe I will
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[Enrico]	[06:33:46] Starcraftmazter: it provides the most up to date version at the time of the release (for fedora 25 it happened to be php 7.0)
2017-07-04 09:26:03	Starcraftmazter	[06:33:50] I thought maybe people here might be aware of the situation and knew something about how to resolve it
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:34:14] i todl you
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[R]	[06:34:15] compile it
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[Enrico]	[06:34:41] Starcraftmazter: if you are looking for longer support time you might want to look into CentOS and software collections. I use php 7.0 on CentOS 7 via scl
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[Enrico]	[06:35:10] with scl you have all versions from 5.5 to 7.0. They'll add newer versions with time
2017-07-04 09:26:03	hxy	[06:48:51] Hey all, I have a Thinkpad X250, and I can no longer enter the BIOS during startup. I've seen others having this issue, and they seem to be able to fix it by booting into Windows and booting into BIOS/UEFI from there.
2017-07-04 09:26:03	hxy	[06:48:58] e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/34fay2/help_brand_new_t450s_cannot_access_bios/cqu34jn/
2017-07-04 09:26:03	hxy	[06:49:11] Is there any way to do this from Fedora 25?
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[Enrico]	[06:51:10] hxy: looks like it could be as simple as systemctl reboot --firmware-setup  https://superuser.com/questions/519718/linux-on-uefi-how-to-reboot-to-the-uefi-setup-screen-like-windows-8-can
2017-07-04 09:26:03	hxy	[06:51:59] Wow, thanks [Enrico]. I'll give that a shot.
2017-07-04 09:26:03	[Enrico]	[06:52:00] hxy: it works only if you have UEFI enabled and if you installed Fedora in UEFI mode.
2017-07-04 09:26:03	hxy	[06:56:17] [Enrico], that worked perfectly. Thanks a lot!
2017-07-04 09:26:03	smurfendrek123	[08:11:28] Should i be installing any drivers for my amd gpu if i want to play tf2, or are those installed by default? I'm on fedora 26 with an amd 6850
2017-07-04 09:26:03	smurfendrek123	[08:15:47] because now it stutters a bit

I think that its because i have Debian installed in the same EFI with windows and it doesn't have anymore space. How do i free the space in the EFI partition without compromizing my windows boot?

2017-07-04 16:49:06	Khaytsus	I think if you switch to KDE< it still defaults to gdm for login manager.  ie;  Doesn't change it.

2017-07-05 09:19:24	dllbrt	[20:05:32] Hello. Was any code discarded in making the Fedora installer handle UEFI systems? Was the code to identify and handle legacy partition tables discarded?
2017-07-05 09:19:24	dllbrt	[20:06:36] For example, the upgrade Mageia 5.1 can't handle partition tables and formats created by Mageia 5.0 because of UEFI-only disk handling
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:07:18] Could that be a factor creating installation issues for Fedora 24, 25, etc?
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:08:05] The code to identify and work with old partition tables as well as new UEFI tables really should be in the installer code
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:09:35] dllbrt: what/
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:12:12] Just like some GNU Linux releases use i386 code for 32-bit though not many are running 30-year-old systems. A lot of users are around using older systems and want to keep their old partitions, whether the processor is 32-bit, 64-bit, legacy or UEFI.
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:12:54] less rambling...
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:13:41] I tried installing 26 beta, 25 and 24 and the installation failed either because of some undefined fatal error, or for version 24, failure to write the boot code to the disk
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:14:13] that sounds unfortunate.. guess you should file a bug report
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:14:39] Yeah. But someone else should have by this time too
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:14:47] lol
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:14:50] well, obviously not
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:15:45] I found that installer bug in Mageia 5.1 and wondered if recent Fedora installer code has the same flaw
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:16:37] as there very well may be some common code involved in writing the grub2 boot code to disk
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:16:39] bugs in other dists have nothing to do with fedora
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:16:56] but like i said
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:16:59] [04:14:13] <[R]> that sounds unfortunate.. guess you should file a bug report
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:18:38] I should. I'm happy to report that Fedora 23 seems to install right
2017-07-05 09:19:25	M_aD	[20:24:11] dllbrt: but it isn't supported anymore
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:26:29] Even so, it works. It brought an old clunker Compaq back to life. And fair enough, the later versions do need some support  :-)
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:27:37] Seriously, someone should look to see if some vital legacy code was removed from the installer for recent releases
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:29:44] sure
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:29:45] file a bug report
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:29:50] and someone will get right on that
2017-07-05 09:19:25	maxcell_	[20:30:54] i wish i could use fedora, but anaconda is trolling me and i can't install
2017-07-05 09:19:25	[R]	[20:31:40] that sounds unfortunate

2017-07-05 09:19:25	maxcell_	[20:32:02] always liked red hat
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[20:43:34] What would the installer component be?

2017-07-05 09:19:25	Phanes	[21:04:14] [R], you're unfortunate
2017-07-05 09:19:25	dllbrt	[21:58:08] Got the bug filed. Also found that the system info shown in the default system hardware display doesn't show processor info of the sort to determine processor type for the bug report. Had to ask Wikipedia!

2017-07-05 09:42:36	lpancescu	see the top two entries in the changelog here https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=913370
2017-07-05 09:42:40	linuxmodder	using f25 stable updates correct?
2017-07-05 09:42:48	lpancescu	yes
2017-07-05 09:42:57	linuxmodder	aka dnf update in the vanilla usage on 25
2017-07-05 09:43:15	lpancescu	dnf upgrade, but yes :)

2017-07-05 09:43:53	linuxmodder	uname -r  shows what?
2017-07-05 09:44:04	linuxmodder	for your present system you're referring to
2017-07-05 09:44:10	lpancescu	i know... upgrade should replace update

2017-07-05 09:45:01	linuxmodder	looking where for the changelog on the package?
2017-07-05 09:45:14	lpancescu	rpm -q --changelog kernel-core
2017-07-05 09:46:09	lpancescu	same with kernel instead of kernel-core
2017-07-05 09:47:37	linuxmodder	well lpancescu  that is indeed strange as crap, mention that in #fedora-kernel and if you don't mind letting them know same behaviour holds true on .8-300
2017-07-05 09:48:31	lpancescu	i saw labbott in -devel, wanted to ask her there :) - i'll ask in -kernel, thanks
2017-07-05 09:48:53	linuxmodder	nice catch btw
2017-07-05 09:49:08	linuxmodder	or -devel works

2017-07-05 09:50:42	lpancescu	linuxmodder, i was actually curious if fedora also had a kernel regression wrt to the stack clash fix (like debian and centos), so i thought to look at the changelog... which confused me

2017-07-05 09:52:20	lpancescu	linuxmodder, yes... in debian some java software broke. for EL, see https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017-1674.html
2017-07-05 09:52:27	Southern_Gentlem	that is what creates the kernel-core
2017-07-05 09:52:44	lpancescu	they both released bugfix kernels
2017-07-05 09:52:47	linuxmodder	Southern_Gentlem,  it's the fact that and the one in rpm -q --changelog are NOT jiving

2017-07-05 09:56:49	lpancescu	both debian and RH published the stack clash patch on 07-19, the upstream patch was still in beta, if that. i assume the two distros developed their own patches - if fedora got the upstream kernel fix, maybe it was right from the beginning

2017-07-05 10:06:56	lpancescu	that does return the expected changelog. i assume all other packages are upgraded, instead of being installed in parallel, so this is why i never hit this before. kind of confusing, though

2017-07-05 16:47:14	Roxxor91	Hi! I just installed Fedora 25! Works great! But I would like to adjust my touchpad behaviour (way more than GNOME settings allow me). I still have an old xorg.conf lying around with all my modifications. But as I see, wayland does not use those anymore, right? How can I modify my synaptics touchpad behaviour now?

2017-07-06 10:05:04	drakonis	[23:07:58] and what a mess it is.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	kk4ewt	[23:08:21] then i suggest you edit your dnf.conf and change true to false
2017-07-06 10:05:04	drakonis	[23:08:21] i installed the option that covers audio production and i want to clean it up

2017-07-06 10:05:04	gl278afd	[02:58:40] what is the best way to enable python 3.6 support on FC 25?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	[R]	[03:05:39] gl278afd: what do you mean "enable"4
2017-07-06 10:05:04	gl278afd	[03:06:08] i need python 3.6.1 in FC 25
2017-07-06 10:05:04	[R]	[03:06:34] well, 3.5 is provided for 25
2017-07-06 10:05:04	[R]	[03:06:36] so either compile it yourself
2017-07-06 10:05:04	[R]	[03:06:37] or update
2017-07-06 10:05:04	[R]	[03:06:39] to 26
2017-07-06 10:05:04	gl278afd	[03:07:15] fc26 is not out
2017-07-06 10:05:04	[R]	[03:07:24] so use the beta or wait
2017-07-06 10:05:04	gl278afd	[03:07:34] brilliant advice :)
2017-07-06 10:05:04	gl278afd	[03:09:53] //rm

2017-07-06 10:05:04	Bheru27	[03:11:09] f26 goes out next week and the guy was urged
2017-07-06 10:05:04	Asmodee	[03:11:29] if it is not delayed, f26 is out in about 5 days though
2017-07-06 10:05:04	Bheru27	[03:11:45] yeah
2017-07-06 10:05:04	Asmodee	[03:13:15] I never tried, but I would guess compiling python and make it work, would take about that time :)
2017-07-06 10:05:04	Asmodee	[03:15:28] maybe even more if not used to cmpiling
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[04:17:35] @EOL F25
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[04:17:55] Guys help me out. When is F25 eol?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	Bheru27	[04:18:49] uh
2017-07-06 10:05:04	Bheru27	[04:19:04] isnt it when fedora 27 is released
2017-07-06 10:05:04	[R]	[04:19:24] !f25eol

2017-07-06 10:05:04	@fedbot	[04:19:30] Fedora 25 will go end of life and no longer supported 1 month after Fedora 27 is released (not scheduled yet, but likely around Nov 2017). So likely sometime around Dec 2017
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[04:19:52] Oh great. Thanks [R]
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[04:20:28] I read this https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/26/Schedule  but couldn't find anything useful
2017-07-06 10:05:04	swift110	[04:39:14] hey all
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[05:41:35] Guys, does /etc/redhat-release return different output for fedora server version and workstation?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[05:41:54] I can't compare it since I don't have a server version.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dziq	[05:51:41] ji
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dziq	[05:51:46] hi
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[05:59:33] Hmm hostnamectl shows the difference.. still not sure what /etc/redhat-release shows
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[06:14:08] I ran into an issue installing a built package. I 'fedpkg mockbuild' the package successfully and installed the '*.src.rpm' file using 'rpm -i', but 'rpm -V' says the rpm file 'is not installed'. Any suggestions? Should I have used 'fedpkg srpm' after 'fedpkg mockbuild'?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:20:52] hi
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[06:21:05] dadada: ji
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:21:13] I want to install Fedora on a SSD from within a working fedora system
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:21:21] so on sda there's my standard normal system
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:21:33] now I've another ssd on sdb and I want to install a bootable fedora there too
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:21:40] so that I can take it and put it into my netbook
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:21:54] I've no usb stick and no cdrom/dvd drive
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:22:00] slazer: hi
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[06:22:30] dadada: is it going to be the same (type of) notebook?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:22:57] slazer: no, one is desktop, the other is a baytrail netbook
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[06:23:15] dadada: then I'm afraid it won't work
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:23:23] I had Fedora on that netbook first though, and just put its SSD into the desktop and it has worked ever since without issues
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:23:41] now I just want to use the netbook again
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[06:23:48] dadada: interesting.. maybe Im wrong
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:23:48] slazer: why?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:23:54] I think you're wrong :D
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:24:10] slazer: when you boot from usb stick you get a live installer right?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	Guest79810	[06:24:15] Hello what is possible to against reboots without logs or core dump ?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:24:25] I want such an installer on my working fedora and say to it: please install the system on sdb
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[06:24:29] dadada: I thought the HW config is initialized during installation and when the HDD is changed the HW config won't be compatible provided its not the same type of notebook
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[06:25:08] dadada: I understand.. hold on
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:25:12] slazer: no, there're kernel modules for all types of hardware installed, so as long as it's x86_64 it should work
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:25:38] dd if=/path/to/iso of=/dev/sdb bs=8M
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:25:42] dadada: ^
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:26:01] _val_: that really works?!
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:26:11] definitely
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[06:26:24] sounds cool
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:26:24] have you done that before?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:26:39] otherwise I wouldn't say so.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:26:46] very nice, ty
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:27:19] Have trust in dd. Most of tools out there call dd in the background.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:27:45] downloading the iso
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:28:22] _val_: why bs=8M ?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:28:51] dadada: because you don't want to wait 10 hours?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:29:13] 8M block size is safe to write to the raw device
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:29:29] You can use 4M but it will take twice that long to write to sdb.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:30:16] _val_: there's no way it's taking 10 hours on an ssd, but appreciated
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:30:28] dadada: on legacy slow usb 2.0 I always used 4M since I wasn't sure if it could handle faster rates
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:30:32] the download is what's taking the most time
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:30:42] _val_: it's connected directly to SATA
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:31:20] dadada: still I'd suggest not to use greater block size values.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:32:04] okay... I wouldn't have used bs=8M at all and I would have hoped the system does something sensible
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:32:18] but I'll do what yo say ^^
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:33:32] yo=you
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:39:47] dadada: don't forget to sync and wait until the data has been written. dd might terminate but some data still might be written to the device
2017-07-06 10:05:04	dadada	[06:40:05] okay thanks
2017-07-06 10:05:04	_val_	[06:40:34] On a normal usb flash drive you'd have some visual assitance where a flash light blinks, in your case no flashing lights there :)

2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[07:01:06] ls
2017-07-06 10:05:04	slazer	[07:01:12] sorry
2017-07-06 10:05:04	torstein	[07:27:33] Anyone have an idea how the hell to install this? https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects
2017-07-06 10:05:04	torstein	[07:28:27] I'm on F26 KDE, lots of dependencies missing, libgtk+3-gir and so on and so on, downloading each dep manually is a hassle

2017-07-06 14:37:53	Guest79810	vwbusguy: OK. I was thinking that CenOS, RHEL, Fedora are very similar!! And beyond all that this remains "Linux"...
2017-07-06 14:38:01	grift	boot into grub , edit the kernel boot line by appending emergency, then load the kernel with the modified kernel boot line

2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:11:58] heh and now the touchpad is working again
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:12:05] It'll probably stop working again soon
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:12:12] ie right now
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:12:19] Arbition, sounds like that is a setting
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:12:35] lshw not tab completing
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:12:43] is that it's own package?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:12:51] Arbition, yup
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:13:13] Arbition, install it. unique and good info in there
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:13:54] https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/cnCkrFELDSLyiKdtvC7t0w/
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:13:57] funny... it uses available info.. but just displays it
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:15:04] ?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:15:21] Arbition, k, so lenovo used a different component for my device
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:15:35] yes, this is a whole pad click
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:15:44] I had an L520 which also had a different keyboard
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:16:20] Arbition, so how i worked around this was a setting for the touch pad
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:16:45] Arbition, lemme see if i can find that
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:17:26] Arbition, pretty sure the gnome-settings panel helped me in the past
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:17:59] gnome-control-center
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:18:09] what setting am I looking for though
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:18:22] Arbition, if that allows you to tune the touchpad, yes....
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:18:37] not really
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:18:51] you can set scroll types etc
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:19:01] Nothing about deadzones or anything though
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:19:05] just a speed setting
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:19:38] though adjusting that any direction seems to reset it, albeit temporarily
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:19:53] wait no it doesn't
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:21:35] Arbition, check `gnome-control-center mouse`
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:21:52] That's where I was
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:22:40] Arbition, that is where i have solved these issues with my hardware
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:22:56] interesting. It continues to drift, but sometimes the touchpad works
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:23:41] Hm yes, touching the nipple does seem to affect the behaviour
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:23:55] I would note I have never adjusted settings for this
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:24:14] and as I said, this only started happening when I moved to F25
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:24:32] Arbition, well do. because the driver changes based on the HUD
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:24:55] what should I change though? I've just tried fiddling with the touchpad speed. That hasn't changed anything
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:25:03] Nothing else seems relevant to mouse movement
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:25:27] Arbition, i just use the qwerty
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:25:44] huh?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:26:09] Arbition, so the nipple is decent for certain actions,  but i generally use the touchpand
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:26:30] Arbition, oh.. the keyboard
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:26:46] I almost exclusively use the touchpad
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:26:56] Arbition, qwerty is a standard
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:27:04] for the keyboard sure
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:27:11] but I don't get what that has to do with the mouse settings
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:27:56] Arbition, k, so there is a setting to make the touchpad more prevalent
2017-07-07 09:24:52	 *	daMaestro [03:29:03] still looking
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:30:03] well I don't see anything interesting in gnome-tweak-tool
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:36:13] ah, workaround for disabling the nipple xinput disable 13 (id=13 gotten from xinput without parameters)
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:37:04] Arbition, so keep finding this, you'll make your hardware work with the kernel
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:37:41] I have yet to diagnose why sometimes neither works at all though
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:37:47] another boot cycle I guess
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:37:51] Arbition, i usually use the looking glass as it seems to be the smoke test
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:38:50] Arbition, gotta jet for an early morning
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:38:58] ok
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Arbition	[03:39:06] well this workaround should help some
2017-07-07 09:24:52	daMaestro	[03:39:08] Arbition, hopefully you can figure this out.
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Ace__	[05:53:29] is scikit learn available in the standard repo?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Ace__	[05:54:06] official. says use pip, but searching scikit-learn shows up python2-scikit-learn and python3-scikit-learn
2017-07-07 09:24:52	_val_	[06:15:23] Hi. Is there any substantial difference between fedora-ws ks file versus fedora-server ks file?  Is the --url different or %packages section?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	valerio	[06:51:12] ehi guys, what's the easiest way to install 4.12 on f25?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	kwizart	[06:57:20] valerio, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RawhideKernelNodebug
2017-07-07 09:24:52	valerio	[06:58:21] kwizart: grazie!
2017-07-07 09:24:52	liquidLD_	[07:07:22] hello here too
2017-07-07 09:24:52	liquidLD_	[07:07:27]  i have some issues with kernel 4.11 from fedora 24. Im trying to compile a wifi module for rtl 8192cu. While on kernel 4.5.5 and 4.8.16 the 'make-sudo make install' works perfectly,in kernel 4.11 I get this >
2017-07-07 09:24:52	liquidLD_	[07:07:37] "Cannot use CONFIG_STACK_VALIDATION, please install libelf-dev, libelf-devel or elfutils-libelf-devel"  cc1: some warnings being treated as errors scripts/Makefile.build:294: recipe for target '/home/liquid/DescÄƒrcÄƒri/rtl8192cu-fixes-master/core/rtw_cmd.o' failed make[2]: *** [/home/liquid/DescÄƒrcÄƒri/rtl8192cu-fixes-master/core/rtw_cmd.o] Error 1 Makefile:1496: recipe for target '_module_/home/liquid/DescÄƒrcÄƒri/rtl8192cu-fix
2017-07-07 09:24:52	liquidLD_	[07:07:56] i have installed libelf stuff to no avail
2017-07-07 09:24:52	liquidLD_	[07:09:36] also this at the end : "Makefile:584: recipe for target 'modules' failed make: *** [modules] Error 2"
2017-07-07 09:24:52	liquidLD_	[07:10:41] note : I have make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel installed.
2017-07-07 09:24:52	liquidLD_	[07:19:33] oh ,nevermind. i'll remove kernel 4.11 altogether. They seem to screw us with every new kernel release. Not only that the rtl8192 wifi kernel driver has been broken for years (20 kb/sec speed with it), but they made it impossible to actually build and use the FIXED wifi driver with latest kernels !
2017-07-07 09:24:52	_val_	[08:40:40] Guys, is there a fedora-server mirror? I'm reading: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Repositories  which mensions https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=fedora-server-26&arch=x86_64  but there is no fedra-server-26&...
2017-07-07 09:24:52	_val_	[08:40:47] Any idea?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[08:55:02] _val_: I imagine RC's are not on the mirrors, once 26 is released it should be there
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[08:56:02] 10th/11th July
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[08:58:21] _val_: The latest RC is here https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/stage/26_RC-1.5/Server/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-26-1.5.iso. Which is what will be the final release
2017-07-07 09:24:52	_val_	[09:00:18] puffi: thanks. I thought I had to use another mirror for the fedora-server
2017-07-07 09:24:52	_val_	[09:00:35] in my ks.cfg I'm using url --mirrorlist=http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=fedora-25-$releasever&arch=$basearch
2017-07-07 09:24:52	_val_	[09:00:54] It seems to work fine now. Thanks for the link.
2017-07-07 09:24:52	makism	[09:05:25] hey guys, i have a luks partition from my previous fedora installation, but on boot i'm not promted for a passwd to unlock it
2017-07-07 09:24:52	makism	[09:05:27] any idea? :S
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:11:30] _val since yesterday when f26 was marked as go, they have the weekend to populate the servers for release on tuesday
2017-07-07 09:24:52	_val_	[09:12:49] Southern_Gentlem: cool. Was yesterday the release date of F26?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[09:12:55] No
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[09:12:58] 11th July
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[09:13:09] But yesterday it was decided that RC1.5 would be the next release
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:13:29] no yesterday was the GO-nogo meeting
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[09:13:40] GOLD@!
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:14:11] and the answer was finally go with release on Tuesday July 11th
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[09:14:36] Southern_Gentlem: Have you started spinning
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:14:58] puffi,  i have did some test spins of f26 yes
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:15:08] i know my procedures work
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:16:04] the next spin will be the last for F25
2017-07-07 09:24:52	_val_	[09:16:23] Ah great!
2017-07-07 09:24:52	puffi	[09:16:32] Southern_Gentlem: You don't do them up to EOL?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:18:15] nope
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:20:04] puffi, if f26 is that much of a dog then i may extend spinning f25 but from my testing its actually fairly usable
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:20:35] puffi,  why should i promote installing older releases
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:21:36] also we need time to upgrade our builder to f26 and test builds on that before releasing
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Khaytsus	[09:22:32] Southern_Gentlem: F26 is a dog?  Or just a phrase? ;)
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Southern_Gentlem	[09:22:54] Khaytsus, i did say if
2017-07-07 09:24:52	thingfish	[09:24:40] I'll be satisfied if F26 successfully gets me to a desktop.  When I try the Beta, it installs fine but locks hard booting to the desktop after login.

I'd never used vbox much except for a few things that were "pre-packaged" in vbox images.  libvirt works very well for all OSes I've tried.  All Fedora, CentOS, and I have like 7 variations of Winblows on a machine at work in libvirt.

2017-07-07 10:58:06	Southern_Gentlem	linuxmodder,  i think they might have pushed the fedora-release yesterday
2017-07-07 10:58:21	Southern_Gentlem	smurfendrek123,  rpm -q fedora-release
2017-07-07 10:58:24	smurfendrek123	linuxmodder, well they should advertize the torrents a bit better
2017-07-07 10:58:30	_val_	I was just not sure if I had to use the same --url line in the kickstart file which I'm deploying for fedora workstation and server

2017-07-07 16:36:34	Southern_Gentlem	heis2201, ok your question and rant is why the lives 1) ease of installing with all the updates at the time of creation 2) its a lot lower bar than the net installs for Endusers
2017-07-07 16:36:55	Southern_Gentlem	especially the updated isos
2017-07-07 16:37:47	Southern_Gentlem	otherwise they pull the gold isos and then have all the vulnerbilities at the time point

2017-07-07 16:39:02	Southern_Gentlem	and yes they are good to have around for troubleshooting as well
2017-07-07 16:39:54	Southern_Gentlem	thats why i have been providing updated isos in one form or another since fc5

2017-07-07 16:44:13	Southern_Gentlem	double check with nvidia to see what driver you should using
2017-07-07 16:44:20	LoganJ	Southern_Gentlem, I've given up on that box; I've gotten it to work on everything with Intel graphics

2017-07-07 16:44:42	LoganJ	Southern_Gentlem, Main problem was with Wayland; drivers are just horrible with Wayland-based DEs

2017-07-10 09:25:26	[R]	[00:32:33] the "default" in fedora is wayland... so...
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Phanes	[00:32:55] Oh weird.  How did I end up with Xorg?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Phanes	[00:33:02] lol
2017-07-10 09:25:26	[R]	[00:33:11] if you're not using the defaults...
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Phanes	[00:33:28] it is a fresh install of a default system using the official image
2017-07-10 09:25:26	[R]	[00:33:36] well the default is gnome on wayland...
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Phanes	[00:33:56] oh, i chose lx during install
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Phanes	[00:34:30] would not think the desktop manager selection would dtermine which graphical server i get, but interesting
2017-07-10 09:25:26	[R]	[00:34:40] well, gnome is the only one that uses wayland
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Phanes	[00:36:36] would thnk that would be decoupled from DE.  oh well.  i need to find a compositor for X.  any suggestions?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	[R]	[00:37:39] you need?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	[R]	[00:37:40] lol

2017-07-10 09:25:26	[R]	[00:40:55] thats a library
2017-07-10 09:25:26	[R]	[00:40:56] not a compositor...
2017-07-10 09:25:26	chilli0	[00:46:31] pmcnabb, chder mutk , after a reboot it's working now. I think it was from adjusting nsswitch

2017-07-10 09:25:26	Phanes	[00:47:00] [R], right

2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:04:06] i've installed many linux distros on one computer (efi) but i want fedora to manage the grub entries. grub2-install gives me a nice grub shell, at boot
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:04:28] what's the proper way to add a fedora boot manager to the efi computers?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	jhasse	[04:11:44] Hi :) How can I download the rpmspec file of a package?

2017-07-10 09:25:26	jhasse	[04:16:47] zdohnal, I don't have the rpm yet though. Is there an easy command to do both, download the package and extract the specfile?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	zdohnal	[04:19:18] jhasse: Sorry I do not know, but you can download srpms or rpms from koji.fedoraproject.org AFAIK

2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:26:05] Hi, can I program keyboard macros in fedora?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:26:31] Something similar to ahk
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:30:06] nevermind, grub.cfg was missing
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:30:29] however, it still remains a mistery what is the default fedora boot manager and how to handle it
2017-07-10 09:25:26	hpotter	[04:30:46] pepe_le_pew: This mostly depends on DE, but distrib. I mean you should ask sbout hotkeys in your DE.
2017-07-10 09:25:26	hpotter	[04:31:40] pepe_le_pew: /me is using ~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml for this in openbox.
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:32:55] Ok
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:33:27] So you can execute scripts with keychords
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:33:37] For example?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	hpotter	[04:33:58] Yes. :
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:34:52] I don't think GNOME has this capability
2017-07-10 09:25:26	hpotter	[04:35:09] I think it must have.
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:35:24] gome keyboard shortcuts
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:36:41] Maybe that it can
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:36:57] But macro programming I don't think so
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:37:42] I was thinking of using xbindkeys with another keyboard
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:38:03] Additional
2017-07-10 09:25:26	ahutsona	[04:48:06] When is REHL most likely to adopt dnf?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:50:19] i would think rhel 8
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:50:32] but i do not _know_
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:53:16] Will f26 have better nvidia Wayland support?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:53:41] yes
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:53:50] of course, better is just a word
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:53:59] so it depends on your particular needs
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:54:37] Basically,  not crashing the session
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:54:50] I had to revert to xorg
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[04:55:19] To use rpmfusion drivers
2017-07-10 09:25:26	ahutsona	[04:55:29] rehl 8 is so far away 7.4 beta was just released.
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:55:50] i doubt dnf will be inbtroduced in rhel7
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[04:56:09] baut maybe asa technology preview, at some point in time
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Ace__	[05:02:36] F25, I have added another email account to evolution, but seems like the calendar events are not showing up, anyone know why?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	kwizart	[05:04:10] pepe_le_pew, gnome3 with wayland in fedora doesn't yet support nvidia (or the other way, as you like)
2017-07-10 09:25:26	kwizart	[05:04:21] pepe_le_pew, so it's automatically fallback to Xorg
2017-07-10 09:25:26	kwizart	[05:05:30] pepe_le_pew, now it should be ready once:  1/ nvidia-drm with modeset=1 stop crashing 2/ mutter has nvidia-egl-wayland support
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[05:06:58] OK, thanks
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[05:07:46] Open drivers are enough anyway
2017-07-10 09:25:26	pepe_le_pew	[05:08:14] But I don't like underused hardware
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[05:10:49] kwizart, i have an nvidia card, how can i tell i run in wayland or xorg?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[05:11:18] it says: gallium 0.4 on NVE7
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[05:12:45] it also says: WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[05:12:48] f26
2017-07-10 09:25:26	kwizart	[05:14:51] cornel, yep WAYLAND_DISPLAY is a good mean to know you are using wayland
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[05:15:04] thank you kwizart
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[05:15:14] now let's see if it still crashes
2017-07-10 09:25:26	kwizart	[05:15:35] cornel, but you are using the nouveau driver, not nvidia proprietary one
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[05:15:42] right
2017-07-10 09:25:26	kwizart	[05:15:45] there it works
2017-07-10 09:25:26	cornel	[05:16:02] i see
2017-07-10 09:25:26	gour	[05:33:25] is tomorrow still tentative date for f26 release?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	kwizart	[05:34:10] gour, f26 is gold, so it's the official release (usually deceided the previous thurday)
2017-07-10 09:25:26	gour	[05:35:47] kwizart: i see...so it seems i can try to do 'dnf system-upgrade'
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Xorg	[08:30:52] sup with the f26 ?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	puffi	[08:41:08] Xorg: Could you be a bit more specific
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Xorg	[08:42:47] ah nvm
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Xorg	[08:42:52] read the date wrong
2017-07-10 09:25:26	Southern_Gentlem	[09:07:28] gour,  i advise on waiting till tomorrow for all the mirrors to finally sync

2017-07-10 15:20:43	N3LRX	If you're running el7.2 ask in #centos or #rhel this is #fedora

2017-07-10 15:23:14	SuperLag	N3LRX: I knew this is #fedora but I figured I'd ask here as this is where dev happens first, is it not? :)

2017-07-10 17:37:33	davidstrauss	They're all early systemd adopters.
2017-07-10 17:37:55	davidstrauss	Suse focuses more on scientific and supercomputer work, as well as *some* corporate stuff.
2017-07-10 17:38:05	davidstrauss	Arch is more hobbyist.

2017-07-10 17:39:57	davidstrauss	Also, Suse sort of has a RHEL/Fedora sort of split with their enterprise vs. rolling/normal releases.
2017-07-10 17:40:11	davidstrauss	So, Suse isn't just one distro in that sense.

2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[02:52:30] is that a requirement, jcgruenhage ?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[02:52:57] randomuser, naw, more just i would not do a netinstall on release day (that was my recommendation)
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[02:53:08] i'm just thinking that an ISO that has specifically and only what jcgruenhage is looking for is unlikely
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[02:53:42] but yeah, why not wait for mirror traffic to calm down
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[02:54:01] randomuser, very sure that is the case. in the example brought up was a prod server install .. and i said it'd be best to just download the full iso so you don't need network to complete the install
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[02:55:00] we could have a lot more fun talking about production deployment methodologies :)
2017-07-11 09:14:38	jcgruenhage	[02:57:20] I wouldn't have a problem with having 6 gigs of unnecessary data in the iso, if you tell me a full install image works better on release day
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[02:58:05] you'll have the same system either way once you've installed and updated
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[02:58:50] also, there is no six gig everything ISO
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[03:00:04] the lxqt spin is probably your best bet if you really want offline install of a minimal DE
2017-07-11 09:14:38	jcgruenhage	[03:00:29] Thats not i3 though :P
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[03:00:31] if it's a server, then use the server images and do not use a DE
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[03:00:50] nope, there is no i3 spin, you'll have to install packages after installation
2017-07-11 09:14:38	jcgruenhage	[03:01:21] I need a DE for a VM.. i'd avoid that if possible, but it's sadly no option
2017-07-11 09:14:38	randomuser	[03:01:41] it's always an *option* :)
2017-07-11 09:14:38	jcgruenhage	[03:01:54] I guess I'll just do a netinstall two days later
2017-07-11 09:14:38	jcgruenhage	[03:03:36] The mirrors should have synchronized till then
2017-07-11 09:14:38	rhct-	[04:03:20] hi all

2017-07-11 09:14:38	mozzarella	[04:06:20] just ask your question and maybe someone will answer
2017-07-11 09:14:38	mozzarella	[04:06:30] when they see it
2017-07-11 09:14:38	rhct-	[04:06:33] seems like everyone is sleepy
2017-07-11 09:14:38	rhct-	[04:06:41] alright ... here is the question
2017-07-11 09:14:38	rhct-	[04:10:22] I have installed centos 6.8 final with raid 1 level (2 hdds) ..... now i added 2 more hdds (raid0) and the raid controller is board builtin (dell optiplex 9020) .. dmraid -r show all drives, cat /proc/mdstat shows both raid [raid1] [raid2] but df -h shows me nothing, now i want to use this aditional raid0 array on virtualbox vm, dont know cant find this array on it, or may be i am confuse and
2017-07-11 09:14:38	rhct-	[04:10:23] skipping some step, please guide. Regards
2017-07-11 09:14:38	rhct-	[04:11:14] df -h shows me the array (raid1) on which the centos is currently installed.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	linuxmodder	[04:23:16] rhct-, /j #centos for you
2017-07-11 09:14:38	bartmon	[04:27:52] anyone using evolution as a mail client in f25? Viewing a message and selecting File > Preview opens the Print dialog for me, anyone else?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	FMGrungekid	[04:50:20] what time is the release estimated to be coming out? any ideas or is this an unknown?

2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:08:12] the torrents are already online: https://torrent.fedoraproject.org/
2017-07-11 09:14:38	FMGrungekid	[05:11:09] are they the finals?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:11:17] FMGrungekid, yes
2017-07-11 09:14:38	FMGrungekid	[05:11:34] Ah awsome
2017-07-11 09:14:38	FMGrungekid	[05:11:36] thanks guys
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:11:55] FMGrungekid, the repos will not be available until the release time (don't expect dnf to work yet, etc(
2017-07-11 09:14:38	FMGrungekid	[05:12:17] thats ok. Just want to get my usb stick setuo
2017-07-11 09:14:38	FMGrungekid	[05:12:20] etup*
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:12:22] FMGrungekid, but the torrents are the official images being sent to mirrors
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:13:14] FMGrungekid, but... as always ... verify: https://getfedora.org/verify
2017-07-11 09:14:38	 *	daMaestro [05:14:16] doh.. that has not been updated for the new checksums
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:14:21] (yet)
2017-07-11 09:14:38	FMGrungekid	[05:17:25] ah ok. Best waiting then?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:21:38] FMGrungekid, naw, join the torrent. then you have the iso you want and the checksums will be updated soon
2017-07-11 09:14:38	FMGrungekid	[05:22:15] Roger!
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:22:26] FMGrungekid, https://pagure.io/fedora-websites/blob/f26/f/getfedora.org/static/checksums
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:22:40] FMGrungekid, they have been published. jump on the torrent and then verify.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:23:56] s/they have been published/they are available, but not yet published/
2017-07-11 09:14:38	linuxmodder_	[05:44:12] ISOs and checksums are out via torrent and live but slow as crap FMGrungekid
2017-07-11 09:14:38	daMaestro	[05:47:38] linuxmodder_, some are actually moving right now
2017-07-11 09:14:38	linuxmodder_	[05:48:29] only one that I see pulling OFF of my seed atm is SOAS ( mind you I have only the DEs (x64)
2017-07-11 09:14:38	linuxmodder_	[05:48:40] need more space for the LABS
2017-07-11 09:14:38	linuxmodder_	[05:49:00] that will need some lvextend magic tho
2017-07-11 09:14:38	slidercrank	[06:28:52] hello. is it possible to install two versions of java-openjdk at the same time on Fedora? I have java-openjdk-1.8.0 installed from the repo. And I have 1.7.0 as an rpm from Fedora 20. How do I install it at the same time? All file names have a version in their name. So there is no conflict in paths/names.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	slidercrank	[06:30:33] of course, I can manually extract the rpm but then the package manager won't know anything about it. So it's a last resort
2017-07-11 09:14:38	kwizart	[06:30:39] slidercrank, it's not supported on fedora with the official packages, one need to pick the rhel version and rebuild them on fedora (if ever that works)
2017-07-11 09:14:38	[Enrico]	[06:33:28] slidercrank: you might want to consider using centos if you require multiple java versions installed at the same time. CentOS still provides 1.6 1.7 and 1.8, all installable in parallel
2017-07-11 09:14:38	zaq	[06:47:54] hi Where I put katepart user files in Fedora ? The documentation is not verry explicit about it $HOME/.local or $KDEDIR/share/apps/katepart/syntax
2017-07-11 09:14:38	zaq	[06:50:22] kde4-config --prefix give me /usr but nothing about kate or kde4 here
2017-07-11 09:14:38	timothy	[06:51:57] zaq: iirc $HOME/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax
2017-07-11 09:14:38	zaq	[06:53:08] thx timothy where did you find this information ?

2017-07-11 09:14:38	CheckYourSix	[07:50:01] kwizart: Gnome. I'll post the logs, but I think I'm going to just do a fresh install. It won't take very long to get everything installed again.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	kong__	[08:01:57] @linuxmodder thx.is that beta?or that one to be released today?

2017-07-11 09:14:38	cornel	[08:25:35] i get a sighup with dnf
2017-07-11 09:14:38	cornel	[08:25:41] any7body can reproduce?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	cornel	[08:25:44] https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/WyiE3rOtdaj9CgUyCVzLuw

2017-07-11 09:14:38	cornel	[08:27:43] same in f26 :)
2017-07-11 09:14:38	cornel	[08:28:42] in both cases nano is actually installed
2017-07-11 09:14:38	cornel	[08:29:05] so maybe the sighup is from nano itself
2017-07-11 09:14:38	raxet01	[08:31:55] F26 release time noon ?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Drugo	[08:35:45] what time f26 will be released?

2017-07-11 15:34:23	vwbusguy	wahibdon, Dell laptops run off the Intel card by default to save battery life.  You explicitly run individual applications with the nvidia driver.  Fedora will set this up by default with the nouveau driver and you can set DRI_PRIME=1 on the apps you want to use the nvidia GPU
2017-07-11 15:34:32	vwbusguy	wahibdon, but the desktop itself runs off the Intel card by default
2017-07-11 15:34:46	vwbusguy	wahibdon, if the nvidia driver blacklists the intel card, the desktop can't start
2017-07-11 15:35:08	vwbusguy	wahibdon, therefore, if you want to run everything on nvidia you have to turn off the switchable graphics in the BIOS

2017-07-11 15:37:21	linuxplease	user123irc, every time you reinstall a new kernel vbox additions need to be rebuilt, or sometimes vbox needs to update the code on their side. it's not a fedora problem it's a vbox problem

2017-07-11 16:38:01	vwbusguy	raxet01, The other alternative would be to boot a live image, mount your current install and use the dnf from the live image with --installroot to your mounted path.  If that sounds daunting, then a backup and clean install is probably your best path
2017-07-11 16:38:35	raxet01	vwbusguy: so installing over the top f26 over f25 retains grub2.conf?
2017-07-11 16:39:00	vwbusguy	raxet01, well, it's not installing over - it would wipe out your f25 entirely and give you a clean install
2017-07-11 16:39:18	vwbusguy	raxet01, it won't retain the grub but it should detect Windows and allow you to dual boot

2017-07-11 17:22:12	Khaytsus	viktormadarasz: nah.  Just look when you're done, maybe reinstall it.  Or that package is deprecated/renamed/etc

2017-07-11 17:23:42	TMM	viktormadarasz, the worst that could happen is that you need to install lz4-libs, but given that the rpmfusion people didn't care to deprecate it I don't think it'll be super important

2017-07-12 09:42:52	raxet01	[05:29:05] I bet ya I can use rufus on my work laptop to get the setting "GPT partition scheme for UEFI" and that will probably fix the whole blasted issue. Mediawriter apparently doesn't support uefi or?

2017-07-12 09:42:53	enedil	[06:43:47] I followed the instructions
2017-07-12 09:42:53	enedil	[06:44:32] after reboot, I can see the "upgrading" message for a while, but then my notebook reboots and I get back to Fedora 25

2017-07-12 09:42:53	enedil	[06:58:38] RobberPhex: how to get one?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	freakynl	[07:01:01] raxet01: depends, if you boot through efi you'd need to load bootmgfw.efi instead of ntldr. see here for example: https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/482214-Manually-adding-a-new-entry-(e-g-Windows)-to-the-GRUB2-EFI-boot-loader-menu
2017-07-12 09:42:53	RobberPhex	[07:02:32] enedil I think it's `dnf system-upgrade log`
2017-07-12 09:42:53	RobberPhex	[07:02:42] enedil you can try this command
2017-07-12 09:42:53	raxet01	[07:02:45] freakynl: thx... looking at it now
2017-07-12 09:42:53	enedil	[07:07:02] RobberPhex: it pipes the output to `less`. Can I redirect it to file?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	enedil	[07:07:24] so I can post it

2017-07-12 09:42:53	freakynl	[07:11:15] raxet01: maybe you have multiple system efi partitions
2017-07-12 09:42:53	freakynl	[07:11:35] raxet01: maybe you do use bios
2017-07-12 09:42:53	NullTheSecond	[07:11:45] What's this for enedil ?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	raxet01	[07:11:57] freakynl: nope... just have /dev/sda for f26 and /dev/sdb for Windows 10.

2017-07-12 09:42:53	RobberPhex	[07:20:50] enedil do you run `sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=26` before `sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot`?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	enedil	[07:21:03] RobberPhex: yes I did
2017-07-12 09:42:53	enedil	[07:26:31] I fear it's a hardware issue
2017-07-12 09:42:53	RobberPhex	[07:30:31] enedil I cannot find anything wrong from log, you can add ` -d9` to `ExecStart` on file `/lib/systemd/system/dnf-system-upgrade.service`
2017-07-12 09:42:53	freakynl	[07:30:38] raxet01: well then you probably have a system efi partition on /dev/sdb that has the windows efi loaders on it
2017-07-12 09:42:53	RobberPhex	[07:31:10] enedil then you try upgrade again, and will get more detail log.

2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[07:49:22] hi, i see that even after uninstalling evolution via GNOME Software, there are still evolution processes that take over 40 MB of RAM. Can i safely remove those?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[07:52:27] F26 that is. When i do 'sudo dnf list | grep evolution' it shows a big list. Trying to remove them 'sudo dnf remove evolution*' wants to also remove mutter, gnome-shell and so on :) Can I do something about it?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	user123irc	[08:01:18] wine and playonlinux doesint work ok on F26  cannot launch MS office 2010 after upgrade  or cannot even reinstall it
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:02:36] user123irc: for Office you can try running virtual machine with Windows
2017-07-12 09:42:53	user123irc	[08:07:56] pawiecki,  I use VM with windows , but office on linux was thing that can be uset fast and now its not working
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:11:08] Well it's not supported, and Wine is cool, but it's not a proper solution. F26 is fresh and it can be problematic right after release. You can try to go back to F25 or wait for a solution to become available(you have a backup right? :)
2017-07-12 09:42:53	dreinull	[08:11:37] I want to use a copr repo to install something but it doesn't work. Is it because it is marked for f25 and I have f26? https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/postmodern/chruby/
2017-07-12 09:42:53	smurfendrek123	[08:12:10] Hello, with rawhide having an automated test system, is it now about as stable as tumbleweed?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	freakynl	[08:12:19] Hmm vmware remote console segfaults since upgrading to 26
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:12:52] dreinull: well that seems reasonable
2017-07-12 09:42:53	dreinull	[08:13:12] pawiecki can I somehow convince dnf to install anyway?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	freakynl	[08:13:37] Any ideas if it's abi incompatibilities due to gcc 7.1? Could be libc too I guess
2017-07-12 09:42:53	szradev_	[08:14:32] hi. i have quesion about font rendering. In the past on f24 i used fedy to tweak font rendering. what can i do in 26? install freetype-freeworld and add config to fontconfig or smth else?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:14:58] smurfendrek123: It's hard to tell, but automated tests do not make a distro more stable. There's more to it. I recommend you to try both systems and judge for yourself. Remember, that hardware and your software selection also play a big part on stability of a system.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	user123irc	[08:15:22] will wait for an update for wine and playonlinux , but there is http://www.spinics.net/lists/fedora-package-announce/msg213845.html   and not working correctly
2017-07-12 09:42:53	smurfendrek123	[08:15:44] pawiecki, well yes, but it will ensure it's at least bootable every time, and that some core components keep working, right?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:18:45] smurfendrek123: well it should. I personally would not recommend rawhide, unless you are experienced and can help with reporting bugs. If you look for a rolling release, from what i've heard - Tumbleweed is a good choice.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	smurfendrek123	[08:19:19] pawiecki, what are the differences between current rawhide and tumbleweed that make tumbleweed more suitable?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:20:35] dreinull: i'm not sure you can. Maybe contact a person, that maintains that repo/software to update it for F26. It's a new release of Fedora, so many repos are not ready for it. A good practice is to wait a few months after a new release, so the repos are available for you.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:22:26] smurfendrek123: i'm not an expert, but Fedora does not promote Rawhide for regular users, and is a work-in-progress to be released as the next Fedora version. Tumbleweed on the other hand promotes itself as a system ready to be used daily. That's the main contrast.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	smurfendrek123	[08:23:30] yes but i'm wondering about technical differences, because afaik leap also gets branched off tumbleweed
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:29:07] smurfendrek123: to sum up (imho) - tumbleweed is a product - a rolling distro. Rawhide is a work-in-progress to be released as product - next Fedora. I do not recommend Rawhide over tumbleweed if you need a rolling distro. If you want a 'traditional' OS, Fedora 26 is great.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	smurfendrek123	[08:29:23] pawiecki, thanks a lot
2017-07-12 09:42:53	azaki	[08:32:09] apparently rawhide is gonna be alpha from now on.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	azaki	[08:32:24] they've cut alpha releases out of their release schedule
2017-07-12 09:42:53	azaki	[08:32:40] so rawhide itself will be at alpha quality. then there'll be a beta, and then release.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	azaki	[08:32:49] so that's pretty cool.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:32:55] i think that's good
2017-07-12 09:42:53	azaki	[08:33:07] yeah.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	noselasd	[08:43:16] How do I permanently disable systemd-coredump ?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:44:17] noselasd: this might be helpful (or not): https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/659
2017-07-12 09:42:53	vurpo	[08:46:15] okay, so now using VLC has crashed gnome-shell twice on F26 for me
2017-07-12 09:42:53	vurpo	[08:46:21] where do I complain? :^)
2017-07-12 09:42:53	pawiecki	[08:48:25] vurpo: bugzilla, here, to your friends... ;)
2017-07-12 09:42:53	tomodachi	[08:48:26] probably you need some more data ,  maybe you need to check if its gnome , vlc or perhaps your gfx driver causing the problems
2017-07-12 09:42:53	vurpo	[09:05:02] any idea where I can find crash logs? I couldn't find anything interesting in dmesg or the journal
2017-07-12 09:42:53	Southern_Gentlem	[09:14:20] noselasd, so have you googled that yet
2017-07-12 09:42:53	loch_raven	[09:20:29] Hello, I have a problem with installing the GStreamer MP3 and H.264 codecs from GNOME Software. I click on "install", a dialog box pops up saying it needs to add a repository for the package. I accept and nothing happens. It doesn't download it and it doesn't install it. Is there a way to do this through dnf at least? I am on a fresh install of Fedora 26.
2017-07-12 09:42:53	smurfendrek123	[09:20:58] loch_raven, did you install rpmfusion?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	loch_raven	[09:23:12] sorry, i closed this by accident
2017-07-12 09:42:53	loch_raven	[09:24:04] I didn't enable RPMFusion. Do I have to do it manually? Software said it's gonna do it on its own but it seems like it didn't
2017-07-12 09:42:53	ChrisWarrick	[09:24:12] How many things will go on fire if I were to upgrade a server to Fedora 26 today?
2017-07-12 09:42:53	loch_raven	[09:24:39] Software also says those plugins are from the repo called "fedora" so
2017-07-12 09:42:53	user123irc	[09:31:23] ChrisWarrick  for me after upgrate only playonlinux and wine is not ok , Vbox neded fix and thats it
2017-07-12 09:42:53	loch_raven	[09:35:18] ok so I enabled RPMFusion but everything is still the same, the codecs refuse to download or install, and other stuff on Software installs fine
2017-07-12 09:42:53	kwizart	[09:36:27] loch_raven, use sudo dnf groupupdate "Multimedia"
2017-07-12 09:42:53	kwizart	[09:36:40] I will try to document that

2017-07-12 10:15:31	Southern_Gentlem	kwizart i agree with the rpmfusion repos it shouldnt be an issue but even the dnf systemupgrade wiki page say that fedora really cant control third party repos and its your choice

2017-07-12 10:20:15	Southern_Gentlem	If some of your packages have unsatisfied dependencies, the upgrade will refuse to continue until you run it again with an extra --allowerasing option. This often happens with packages installed from third-party repositories for which an updated repositories hasn't been yet published. Please study very careful the output and examine which packages are going to be removed. None of them should be essential for system functionality, but
2017-07-12 10:20:15	Southern_Gentlem	some of them might be important for your productivity.

2017-07-12 10:21:37	Southern_Gentlem	explian why
2017-07-12 10:21:51	Khaytsus	Southern_Gentlem: I'm of the opinion that a safe repo should work and if it's not safe, the third party packages should be entirely removed (not just the repos disabled)
2017-07-12 10:22:09	Khaytsus	Because if a really poorly written rpm is on the system hanging onto an old glib or such...  It might hose everything.

2017-07-12 12:01:55	dowdle	raxet01: I would hope you could "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg" it would probe what's there and then add it for you.  If the second drive with Windows was present during the install / upgrade it should have automatically done that for you.

Fedora's latest version is still 1.33.8. I get a fatal error that stops the process; please see it in the Fedora's paste bin at https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/e6dZAB2LwL39wvgdZo-D4g . Basically, it says the compiler is missing a header file defined in the source code: wx/str
2017-07-12 20:43:47	Born2Fly	ing.h.  I unsuccessfully tried to find which package provides the file. Could anybody help me find the package providing the file? I would really appreciate any help I could get. Thank you for your consideration!

2017-07-12 21:05:24	Born2Fly	Kyth - right, they are wxwidgets. I did search wx, I came up with two or three options: one for GTK2, one for GTK3, and one for GTK3 that has compatibility links to GTK2. Namely: wxGTK-devel, wxGTK3-devel, and compat-wxGTK-gtk2-devel. Of the three, only the last two have the file. However, it's not in the directory the source code it's looking for (/usr/include/wx). I have all three packages installed, and I still get the error.
2017-07-12 21:05:26	raxet01	Jordan_U: UEFI and Anaconda recognized both drives
2017-07-12 21:05:52	Kyth	There's no plain wx-devel?

2017-07-12 21:07:29	Born2Fly	lucas-arg: I am not sure  what I should understand by "fedora-restricted-extras". Do you refer to extra packages that are restricted in fedora because of some issues, e.g. licensing?
2017-07-12 21:07:52	pdobrogost	 Btw, I finally found a person who helped me fix X server binding only 7 out of 8 GPUs.

2017-07-12 21:08:43	Born2Fly	Correct, no plain wx-devel! :)
2017-07-12 21:10:52	Born2Fly	In fact, unless I I install wxGTK-devel (the gtk2 version) there is no /usr/include/wx directory... however, the wxGTK-devel doesn't have the file.

2017-07-13 10:42:01	wahibdon	digitalboy, I have the same issue.  Though, I have never tried to fix it.  I merely assumed it was because my screen had so many pixels (grub takes up about 1/4 of the screen). But if it is happening to you on scarcely more than a 1080p monitor, I don't know what is causing the issue

2017-07-13 11:54:39	dowdle	Firefox gets a new release every 6 weeks (and so does Google Chrome Stable which as mentioned isn't in Fedora)... but GNOME has a six month release cycle as do a number of other things.  I think Fedora should adopt the Atomic release cycle... ever 6 weeks. :)
2017-07-13 11:54:42	prussian	check software collections iNCoNFuN ?
2017-07-13 11:54:46	Southern_Gentlem	how have you tried
2017-07-13 11:54:53	Southern_Gentlem	iNCoNFuN, ^^

2017-07-13 11:57:38	iNCoNFuN	Ok
2017-07-13 11:57:54	avnsgt	Trying to pin down an issue with gitkraken and fedora. Some fonts are not rendering correctly. Apparently this is due to an electron issue. The proposed solution is to rebuild gitkraken with the current version of electron.. Anyone have experience with this?
2017-07-13 11:57:55	muep	are you sure you need exactly 7.0?
2017-07-13 11:58:10	iNCoNFuN	Yes, I need it for Laravel
2017-07-13 11:58:23	muep	php applications in general aren't very picky about which exact version of php you have. at least in my experience
2017-07-13 11:58:43	Qemics	is there a wine rep for fedora 26?
2017-07-13 11:58:50	iNCoNFuN	I use a package which doesn't work with php 7.1
2017-07-13 11:59:03	Southern_Gentlem	Qemics,  wine is in the fedora repos
2017-07-13 11:59:10	Qemics	https://wiki.winehq.org/Fedora look here

2017-07-13 12:00:43	earthw0rm	HI Fedora, I just burned latest Fedora with Rufus. I am trying to boot it on an Acer laptop, and it says "EFI Stub: UEFI secure boot is enabled"
2017-07-13 12:01:04	earthw0rm	Do I just need to disable it, or is there some way to work with it?
2017-07-13 12:01:05	Southern_Gentlem	earthw0rm, so turn off secure boot
2017-07-13 12:01:18	muep	my impression is that this message is not an error message

2017-07-13 12:01:45	muep	fedora is expected to boot just fine with secure boot
2017-07-13 12:02:15	earthw0rm	Hmm, it doesn't seem to get past this message for me
2017-07-13 12:02:53	digitalboy	earthw0rm: On my HP 2570p it boots fine with Secure Boot enabled, do you know if there is a way to disable that message though?
2017-07-13 12:02:57	digitalboy	Fedora 26
2017-07-13 12:03:13	muep	earthw0rm: I think that's some other boot problem. but it would be pretty quick for you to test if disabling secure boot helps
2017-07-13 12:03:17	earthw0rm	Yes, I downloaded F26, latest 64 bit from the web site

2017-07-13 20:12:07	zam	ive run into a problem with fedora 25 and 26, dual booting with windows. on a fresh install i get "setting partition to 0x7" then "a disk read error has ocurred" when selecting windows 7 from grub.  selecting fedora only works after a couple of reboots. when it doesnt work i get an error saying i need to load the kernel first. i have run memtest and disk checks and have found no hardware problems. i checked
2017-07-13 20:12:13	zam	my cables are connected properly. i think this is something related to grub or fedora. i can boot from windows 7 install disk and fix the mbr to get back into windows but if i install grub, this issue starts happening again. the issue does not happen on the same hardware if i install ubuntu (grub2) or slackware (lilo) . i am able to replicate it on 2 disks one is HDD the other SSD. i have checked my grub.cfg
2017-07-13 20:12:19	zam	is correct. i have also tried downgrading to grub 2.02-0.24 from fedora 23 but i get the same issue. any ideas what else i can try? is there some sort of grub debug i can run ?

My system was undergoing a standard update when I let it shut down after all were installed.

When I return to the prior kernel and version,
2017-07-14 01:29:32	TortillaSandwich	everything is apparently fine?

2017-07-14 10:02:07	tellendil	[05:02:23] Hey, I've got a problem trying to setup a transparent proxy on my localhost with support for my docker containers. My rules are https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/ehgRGPtbYEsd0r0iPRIgDQ and if I remove the last one, I get to the web directly. If I add it I get a "no route to host" and squid is not even accessed. Do you have an idea of what I am doing wrong ?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	tellendil	[05:02:55] I used https://github.com/jpetazzo/squid-in-a-can as an inspiration
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Ace___	[05:12:56] has anyone gotten mendeley on F25?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Ace___	[05:13:04] does not seem to be an official guide
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[05:13:19] Not Me, never heard of it
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Ace___	[05:18:08] it's like zotero, reference manager
2017-07-14 10:02:07	toad__	[05:19:29] When I shutdown the computer (F26 KDE) it takes a long time. If I press F12 to get the text output it says "Stop job running.. 13s (1m 30s)" or something like that. How can I figure out what it's attempting to stop?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	tellendil	[05:23:38] toad__: it should display the services on which it is waiting normally (but my guess is Firewalld and/or /var if you have it on a separate partition)
2017-07-14 10:02:07	toad__	[05:25:24] tellendil: it does not display while waiting. I think it displays it afterwards, but the text flashes so quickly I have no chance to read it. I don't have /var on separate partition.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	tellendil	[05:25:59] toad__: Ok that's weird, on gnome it does display it... I don't know then, sorry
2017-07-14 10:02:07	vkolchev	[06:04:21] hi guys, anyone uses conky?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	vkolchev	[06:05:00] I encounter with the following problem - when refreshing it makes fonts bold and vice versa. Is there a setting that I can remove to prevent this?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	M_aD	[06:06:14] vkolchev: maybe better to ask in #conky
2017-07-14 10:02:07	vkolchev	[06:06:39] M_aD, okay, thx , will do
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[06:37:05] Question for anyone on mount NFS Shares, I have not been able to trace this out, but sometimes my NFS4 mounts mount right away, other times, it needs to timeout (~1:30), then fail.  I have been running F24 on most my machines, recently just upgraded (clean XFCE Spin) install, and same issue.  I must have some startup timing issue, any thoughts?  (my FSTAB: https://da.gd/N6uZ , my NFS servers are running F24)
2017-07-14 10:02:07	bikeshedder	[06:37:14] I just upgraded to Fedora 26. And now PostgreSQL doesn't start anymore. Checking the logs I found that the Database needs to be upraded. Now when I run "postgresql-setup --upgrade" it fails during "Creating dump of database schemas"
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[06:39:09] bikeshedder, I can't help you, but generally speaking, I have avoided "upgrades" and resolved to clean installs, sorry if that is a bad answer, just wanted to acknowledge your question.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	bikeshedder	[06:41:24] Never had any troubles when upgrading on a Debian system. I wonder what they do differently. *hmm*
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[06:42:35] bikeshedder, it's asking a lot of a software developer to account for all the things a user might have done to their machine.  It's not fair to compare Debian to Fedora
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[06:42:50] bikeshedder, when you say debian, do you really mean debian, or a variant?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	bikeshedder	[06:43:23] eckirchn, I mean Debian stable. Not a variant.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[06:43:58] bikeshedder, can't help you there, but fedora is bleeding edge, a notch behind ARCH i guess, sure that can start it's own discussion
2017-07-14 10:02:07	bikeshedder	[06:44:00] eckirchn, don't worry. I don't mean to bash Fedora here. Just wondering what could be causing this.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[06:45:32] bikeshedder, since running RH/Fedora since RH5 (~2002), i have been burned by upgrades, Windows has the same issues.  I have learned to lag behind a bit, and only upgrade when needed.  I have had luck with DNF UPGRADE, but I have found best practice is to just install clean.  It's not a good answer, but it's my practice.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	bikeshedder	[06:45:38] eckirchn, I know. Debian stable is old as hell. With the backports it's okay for a server, but I'd never use it for my development machine. After using ubuntu for a while I always had the need to switch Distros after a few months. With Fedora I finally found a system that has stuck with me for several releases now. It's not perfect, but I'm quite happy with it. :)
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[06:47:18] bikeshedder, fedora isn't for everyone, but I have found this room a great resource for help, it's not as popular as it used to be, or my questions have gotten harder.... hmm.. or i have gotten old in my age, and refuse to adapt...
2017-07-14 10:02:07	bikeshedder	[06:53:21] I think I found the issue with the upgrade. pg_dump failed with the following message "pg_dump: [archiver (db)] query failed: ERROR:  could not access file "$libdir/postgis-2.2": No such file or directory"
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[07:00:07] bikeshedder, I think if you resolve the issue, it's always good to state how you upgraded, and was it Fxx to Fxx (version/method)..
2017-07-14 10:02:07	bikeshedder	[07:01:34] I upgraded from F25 to F26 using the DNF_system_upgrade manual from the fedora wiki.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	bikeshedder	[07:02:40] I just found that postgresql-setup --upgrade does not work because pg_dump fails as postgis 2.2 is no longer available. It's now postgis 2.3.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[07:02:58] :)
2017-07-14 10:02:07	newcoder	[07:37:12] What's the command to delete/remove all .rpm and cache with dnf?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	newcoder	[07:37:18] I did: dnf clean all
2017-07-14 10:02:07	newcoder	[07:37:20] is it ok?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	eckirchn	[07:41:36] newcoder "dnf clean all" is safe, everything will rebuild after you issue the next dnf command
2017-07-14 10:02:07	raxet01	[08:59:39] _val_: Not sure I understood your post from yesterday about "negative values..."? On the next fresh install of F27 and beyond I've have decided to disconnect the Windows 10 sata drive cablees. Then, I would just have to reconnect the Windows 10 drive, boot into Fedora version xx, run os-prober, then grub2-mkconfig -o..., back in business with dual boot.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	_val_	[09:03:12] raxet01: My post was that whatever (init) script you were running, there was a bug.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	axoi	[09:03:21] hello! Can anybody help me with wine on fedora? I have problemwith missing gstreamer plugin â€“ but i cannot figure which one i have to install. Here is log. http://paste.asie.pl/Soev
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:04:55] anyone who knows how to get the xorg log using journalctl?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:05:13] "journalctl -e _COMM=Xorg" doesn't work
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:05:17] I get no entries
2017-07-14 10:02:07	raxet01	[09:05:49] _val_: oh lol
2017-07-14 10:02:07	raxet01	[09:06:16] _val_: What would you have hoped it to show?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	_val_	[09:06:26] raxet01: I was hoping to fix that
2017-07-14 10:02:07	_val_	[09:06:32] \Since the problem was obvious
2017-07-14 10:02:07	raxet01	[09:06:38] ah... good to go
2017-07-14 10:02:07	satellit	[09:11:31] what is the dnf install command for Fedora Media Writer?   thanks
2017-07-14 10:02:07	_val_	[09:11:48] dnf install mediawriter
2017-07-14 10:02:07	 *	satellit [09:11:49] in terminal
2017-07-14 10:02:07	satellit	[09:12:29] thanks
2017-07-14 10:02:07	_val_	[09:12:31] satellit: you don't even have to type that all, just: mediawriter
2017-07-14 10:02:07	satellit	[09:14:22] thanks  I was using caps :/
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Southern_Gentlem	[09:16:54] axoi, how did you install wine
2017-07-14 10:02:07	axoi	[09:18:44] Southern_Gentlem: dnf install wine, version is wine 2.11 (staging)
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Southern_Gentlem	[09:24:36] axoi,  ok you can do that and you also can do dnf install playonlinux
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Southern_Gentlem	[09:25:08] which should install all the wine packages you need
2017-07-14 10:02:07	axoi	[09:27:28] Southern_Gentlem: still same error
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Qemics	[09:39:36] how do you open .rar files with xarchiver?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Qemics	[09:39:43] *xarchiver
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Southern_Gentlem	[09:46:01] rar is not open source install unrar from rpmfusion repos
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:48:14] speaking of open source. did you guys read that fedora will officially support the nvidia blob?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:48:52] or more like closed, but anyway
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:49:11] so they kinda changed their open source policy, i guess
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Khaytsus	[09:49:16] sjattah: Where is this?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:49:21] phoronixcom
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:49:26] phoronix.com
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Khaytsus	[09:49:27] And I suspect Fedora would NOT ship it..  it'd be meta, if anything
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:49:51] http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Fedora-NV-GNOME-Soft-HDR
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:50:18] as in some package that will download the actual blob?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Khaytsus	[09:50:42] Like I said; likely meta.  Just automates installing the repo, then installs akmod-nvidia
2017-07-14 10:02:07	sjattah	[09:51:36] maybe you're right
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Khaytsus	[09:53:25] What's sad is comments all make it sound like it's difficult to install on Fedora.  It takes about 4 commands, two of them being installing rpmfusion.  Copy and paste.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	nohitall	[09:59:57] I am very happy with Fedora so far
2017-07-14 10:02:07	vkolchev	[10:01:13] sure, Nvidia installation is piece of cake nowadays.
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Khaytsus	[10:01:19] It has been for 10+ years
2017-07-14 10:02:07	Khaytsus	[10:01:38] When did rpmfusion start packaging it?

Since I don't have any important data stored it was as simple as removing the data directory and calling postgresql-setup --initdb, but if you depend on some postgresql data beware of that issue. :)

2017-07-14 11:43:38	bikeshedder	I just need to get stuff done and don't want to spend several hours to get my machine up and running again. So upgrading is usually my first choice unless something breaks awfully during the update process (never happened so far. all fingers crossed)
2017-07-14 11:43:44	Louis	over time I just screw around with stuff too much and I'd rather start everything fresh... there's always a ton of stuff I've installed that I no-longer or never needed, would rather just clean it all up
2017-07-14 11:44:40	bikeshedder	I keep a system-log.txt in my home folder which lists all installed packages. I revisit that from time to time to see what is no longer needed and what I might just have forgotten around so I start using it again.

2017-07-14 11:46:58	bikeshedder	Nothing new and I don't think there is an easy fix for that. In order to do proper upgrades you need both versions of postgresql installed at the same time. Nothing trivial taken that the current packages use non-versioned directories.

2017-07-14 13:04:47	WebDragon	I just get sudden screenlock, whether I'm active or not
2017-07-14 13:05:12	WebDragon	sometimes it's the screensaver that's frozen. sometimes I'm typing in gvim, or browsing, or in the terminal
2017-07-14 13:05:22	elsammons	exactly, my screen locks up completely, sometimes it will come back after several minutes, most of the time it won't
2017-07-14 13:05:24	WebDragon	this has been going on since before F16
2017-07-14 13:05:44	elsammons	or like yesterday it came back and then locked up again almost immediately and never returned
2017-07-14 13:05:53	WebDragon	I rarely wait for it to come back. usually I come back and can't wake the thing, and the screensaver is fixed in place
2017-07-14 13:06:07	WebDragon	tried switching to xscreensaver, but that didn't fix things
2017-07-14 13:06:11	elsammons	oh mine happens in the middle of my using it

2017-07-14 15:00:53	cactus	Afternoon guys, I'm having a strange issue with VNC and Fedora 26. I am on a LAN with a windows machine that is running TightVNC Server and my local machine (Fedora 26) is using TigerVNC to connect to the windows machine. The command I use is ( $ vncviewer 192.168.1.55:5500 ) and the terminal shows I'm connected to the server but I don't have a window to view the machine. When I disconnect on Fedora 26, it closes the connection and the windows box says
2017-07-14 15:00:53	cactus	"Connection has been gracefully closed."
2017-07-14 15:01:41	cactus	I'm not sure exactly whats going on but after a little research I think it may be due to Wayland not fully supporting VNC? Maybe it's something else I'm overlooking?

2017-07-14 18:15:50	eckirchn	Something has been bugging me for a long time, wondering if anyone has the same issue:  My remote NFS mounts seem to hangup at boot, for the full ~1:30 timeout, then as soon as a qualified user logs in, can run a "mount -a" and they mount.  I used to think this was an issue with boot order versus avahi, but replacing avahi with real IPs doesn't change anything, This was true in as early as F24, including a clean install of F26
2017-07-14 18:16:13	eckirchn	Curious if anyone has this boot order issue?
2017-07-14 18:16:58	linuxmodder	buckroogeek,  what process or user is spewing that ?
2017-07-14 18:17:54	linuxmodder	eckirchn,  are the nfs mount end-point local lan or remote ?  is the machine using bootip or dhcp ?

2017-07-14 18:21:20	eckirchn	linuxmodder, those are good questions, I'll answer the best I can.  1.  Both Client and Server on an Internal local 192.168.x.x netowrk.  2.  I have previously installed the Fedora-server package and the fedora-workstation package.  This current clean install is on 2 machines running the fedora-XFCE ISO spin.  I can't link the issue to anything.  It is NOT 100% consistent, which adds to my confusion.  I had attempted to add a delay servic
2017-07-14 18:21:20	eckirchn	e to the boot sequence on F24, but it seemed to provide the same results as the clean XFCE install.

2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:29:44] Ok.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:30:07] So I need to point it to the swap partition
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:30:16] thanks.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:30:22] what about sleep?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:30:45] more interested in sleep than hibernate.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:30:59] sleep should just work
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:31:26] but again its pretty sensitive tech so might not work with all hardware
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:33:56] even on a desktop?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:34:50] also see what sleep states your bios supports
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:36:02] OK.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:36:02] you should probably see something like this in dmesg:
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:36:05] [    1.623936] ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:36:37] which means that in this case S0 S3 S4 and S5 are supported by the bios
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:36:42] (i think)
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:37:20] https://superuser.com/questions/71835/what-is-the-difference-between-these-four-sleep-states
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:39:09] but that still doesnt mean that it would just work...
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:39:33] depends on what hardware you have and their kernel modules
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:47:22] ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:47:41] I have turned off deep sleep testing out the sleep now.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:47:54] k so atleast that part seems to support both suspend and hibernate
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:51:23] I don't think so I've ever encountered this before, when my laptop and netbook are running absolutely fine on linux but my desktop is not :D
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:51:42] yes same here
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:52:46] what gpu does it have?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:52:55] doesn't have one
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:53:47] a desktop without graphics, thats interesting
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:53:48] I mean doesn't have an external gpu
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:54:05] so its intel or amd?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:54:12] intel dual core
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:54:33] did those have integrated grahpics?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:55:10] as i recall those didnt have it
2017-07-17 09:55:25	grift	[07:55:40] o maybe i am confused with core2duo or whatever
2017-07-17 09:55:25	eeepc	[07:56:58] yes G2030 - intel HD
2017-07-17 09:55:25	nohitall	[08:23:36] its normal to see updates on dnf every few days right?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	nohitall	[08:23:54] just not used to it compared to e.g. debian
2017-07-17 09:55:25	nohitall	[08:24:12] is there some packages for unattenteed security updates?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	[Enrico]	[08:25:29] nohitall: yes it's normal to have frequent updates in dnf, even daily
2017-07-17 09:55:25	[Enrico]	[08:26:24] nohitall: there is no package, to my best knowledge, to do unattented security updates as fedora doesn't support this feature. You have to do all updates, no matter if they are security or not
2017-07-17 09:55:25	[Enrico]	[08:27:09] nohitall: you can install dnf-automatic to do unattended updates
2017-07-17 09:55:25	[Enrico]	[08:27:16] nohitall: see also https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/AutoUpdates
2017-07-17 09:55:25	nohitall	[08:27:50] thanks :)
2017-07-17 09:55:25	nohitall	[08:27:55] so far I love it for my laptop
2017-07-17 09:55:25	nohitall	[08:27:59] works flawless, as I wanted it
2017-07-17 09:55:25	[Enrico]	[08:30:08] nohitall: if you go for unattented updates, I recoomende always checking what got installed periodically and restart the OS when appropriate. Some updates require a system restart to be applied or to not make the system unstable
2017-07-17 09:55:25	nohitall	[08:33:45] [Enrico]: na I will leave it as it is

2017-07-17 09:55:25	techbomber	[09:28:44] if you had 100k us dollars and you had to go all-in on ONE company stock, what company stock would you buy?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	pawiecki	[09:30:42] agronholm: that doesn't sound normal. Share some additional info about your hardware and config
2017-07-17 09:55:25	pawiecki	[09:31:35] techbomber: how is that related to this channel?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:31:40] techbomber,  that is stupid you need to diversify and offtopic for this channel

2017-07-17 09:55:25	pawiecki	[09:35:20] agronholm: upgrade the system or reboot - there's a never kernel available.

2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:35:47] pawiecki,  look at his fpaste
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:36:54] optimus machine, running bumblebee (very iffy) and if he is using the rpmfusion repos he has the kernel-debug stuff so the akmod will not build
2017-07-17 09:55:25	agronholm	[09:37:44] pawiecki: right, so I was not using drivers outside of official repos but I was using rpmfusion so I could get videos to work in chromium
2017-07-17 09:55:25	agronholm	[09:37:55] haven't managed that in F26 yet though
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:38:04] agronholm,  those 2 pastes i asked for please
2017-07-17 09:55:25	agronholm	[09:38:10] coming up

2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:38:59] agronholm,  most people we are seeing with bumblebee has having issues we have been telling them to follow the rpmfusion nvidia howto instead
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:39:34] but we will see by those 2 pastes what you issue maybe
2017-07-17 09:55:25	agronholm	[09:39:47] https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/q4fpwICg6cf3iW9zzv-NfA/
2017-07-17 09:55:25	agronholm	[09:39:52] there you go
2017-07-17 09:55:25	agronholm	[09:48:02] so, should I just try X11 now or was there something odd in my pastes?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	agronholm	[09:51:59] time to reboot I guess
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:54:11] agronholm,  yes get rid of the kernel-debug packages and i dont see any nvidia kmods on your system
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:54:54] so i suspect you are running wayland on intel and/or noveau and the video card is locking up
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Southern_Gentlem	[09:55:05] agronholm take a look at http://rpmfusion.org/Howto/nVidia?highlight=agronholm8CategoryHowtoagronholm9

2017-07-17 10:10:46	agronholm	when was that?
2017-07-17 10:11:50	agronholm	also, does this mean that the only way to get rid of the stuttering performance is to use the nvidia binary driver with X11?
2017-07-17 10:12:54	jgjorgji	did you paste any X logs? might be something in there
2017-07-17 10:13:20	agronholm	how should I extract them?

2017-07-17 10:16:33	[Enrico]	agronholm: well you are confusing a few things here. No offence meant, this is extremely confusing and complex. The official intel driver uses the modesetting Xorg DDX driver

2017-07-17 10:16:45	jgjorgji	well i'd guess so
2017-07-17 10:17:09	[Enrico]	agronholm: nowadays the Xorg DDX is really not where the interesting stuff happens. Most of the stuff happens in the kernel and in mesa (libGL and co.)
2017-07-17 10:17:59	agronholm	I just don't understand what could've changed between F25 and F26 so radically that the performance would drop so drastically

2017-07-17 10:18:12	agronholm	but I suppose I'll just try the nvidia binary driver then

2017-07-17 10:22:10	Adobeman	how does swap work in fedora that may be different than redhat?
2017-07-17 10:22:27	Adobeman	I dont understand why my fedora box is swapping when its not lack of memory
2017-07-17 10:22:40	agronholm	Adobeman: that's actually normal
2017-07-17 10:22:45	Adobeman	hrm?
2017-07-17 10:22:55	[Enrico]	Adobeman: that not wrong by any means. The system detects there is some memory are not used and it frees it up to have more cache

2017-07-17 10:23:56	vurpo	the "swappiness" of a system can be tuned, but generally Linux will swap stuff in and out to keep the more-used stuff in RAM and put less-needed stuff in swap
2017-07-17 10:24:01	[Enrico]	Adobeman: if you don't like it you can change it. However I would not recommend it unless you know what you are doing or adverse effect can occour. It's not a bug, it can be very normal. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness

2017-07-17 10:24:29	[Enrico]	especially when the uptime is long
2017-07-17 10:24:45	Adobeman	but vmstat on fedora is got swpd occupied with all my swap..
2017-07-17 10:24:52	[Enrico]	usually you need to produce some sort of cache pressure to have that, but it's rather easy

2017-07-17 10:28:40	agronholm	[Enrico]: could that be because of lacking support for the gtx 1050?

2017-07-17 10:33:20	phoxis	One is, when I open any window, it takes some time to open and has glitches while maximising and minimising

2017-07-17 10:36:14	phoxis	Any time and very frequent

2017-07-17 10:38:54	jgjorgji	Adobeman: i'd guess some issue with memory balooing and that provides that

2017-07-17 10:39:18	agronholm	[Enrico]: sluggish performance
2017-07-17 10:39:20	jgjorgji	phoxis: do you have a nvidia gpu? might be the same issue
2017-07-17 10:39:23	phoxis	yes
2017-07-17 10:39:29	jgjorgji	might be the same issue as agronholm

2017-07-17 10:39:54	phoxis	I has fedora 21 before with a similar machine, had same problems, resolved as the i915 driver was broken
2017-07-17 10:39:56	Adobeman	total available system memory seem to be going down
2017-07-17 10:40:00	jgjorgji	i'm on f26 since alpha with intel gpu and it's fine so it's something with nvidia
2017-07-17 10:40:26	phoxis	I do not think the nvidia gpu is active
2017-07-17 10:40:42	phoxis	I have tried disabling the nouveau driver
2017-07-17 10:40:46	[Enrico]	agronholm: you can also ask in #intel-gfx for problems with intel driver if you want ti give it another try. It's very odd the performance is not enough for normal desktop
2017-07-17 10:40:52	phoxis	Though I will try it again

2017-07-17 10:50:26	phoxis	Seems that things will be fixed in the udpates
2017-07-17 10:50:35	phoxis	I will try a few things before that

2017-07-17 10:54:11	[Enrico]	agronholm: clear I know that. But the system would use intel for everything by default, unless you configure it otherwise. So I wonder why the lack of acceleration in nouveau would affect the system when using intel
2017-07-17 10:54:31	agronholm	[Enrico]: yep, I couldn't figure that out either
2017-07-17 10:54:35	[Enrico]	not a big deal anyway, you can keep the nvidia driver installed and use intel
2017-07-17 10:54:41	agronholm	but, now it seems to work so I'm happy :)

2017-07-17 12:26:52	grift	afaik the bug was introduced in 233-6
2017-07-17 12:27:06	grift	not sure what version youre one right now?
2017-07-17 12:27:32	alsadi	dowdle: yes fedy is a single click tool to install the "forbidden items", which fedora can't legally distribute (patented open source) or don't want to distribute (closed source)

2017-07-17 12:32:26	grift	i upgraded to rawhide in the meanwhile and there it works fine again

2017-07-17 12:33:08	grift	well err
2017-07-17 12:33:13	grift	it hasnt been fixed

2017-07-17 12:34:03	alsadi	N3LRX: link or it did not happen. personally I don't use fedy and I'm not happy with most of what it offers (like vbox from oracle instead of rpmfusion) but it's not certainly a malware
2017-07-17 12:34:06	grift	they cherry picked some stuff to go in that package and somehow that went wrong

2017-07-17 13:56:15	dyek	grift: Yes, both are available side-by-side, but if Controllers are used as v1 Controller at boot, they are unavailable for v2.
2017-07-17 13:56:36	grift	dyek might be better to ask #systemd
2017-07-17 13:56:45	coreyfarrell	grift: it's system_u:object_r:bin_t:s0
2017-07-17 13:57:00	grift	since systemd pretty claimed ownership
2017-07-17 13:57:03	dyek	grift: Thanks. I have done so already. Waiting...

2017-07-17 14:02:33	linuxmodder	that resulting list is what needs to be in the provisioning script

2017-07-17 14:07:18	grift	anyhow, the packager was probably on drugs
2017-07-17 14:07:34	Mac101	Hi, was wondering if anyone could help me, im trying to suppress/hide a few kernel messages that interupt the nice clean graphical Fedora boot. I got as far as adding "kernel.printk = 3 1 1 3" to /etc/sysctl.conf but this doesn't seem work. In a thread on the Fedora formum I was advsed to add the same to grub, anyone know if this will work?
2017-07-17 14:07:40	linuxmodder	why you say that grift
2017-07-17 14:07:43	grift	because he created a dnfdaemon-selinux package just for setting the context
2017-07-17 14:07:55	coreyfarrell	dnfdragora only installs updates and I'm all up to date.. unless you want I should 'dnf downgrade wget' or something like that?
2017-07-17 14:08:01	grift	/usr/share/dnfdaemon/dnfdaemon-system
2017-07-17 14:08:16	grift	coreyfarrell then just wait for the next update
2017-07-17 14:08:25	grift	but i suspect the issue is this:
2017-07-17 14:08:36	grift	you didnt install dnfdaemon-selinux
