2017-07-03 12:38:50	lwang	aquini, ping looks like we will be respining 7.4 RC kernel
2017-07-03 12:39:21	lwang	after all that complaining from the HW enablement team and networking team,
2017-07-03 12:39:24	aquini	lwang: do we have a date for that respin?
2017-07-03 12:39:36	lwang	we are respiing for their patches
2017-07-03 12:40:15	lwang	aquini, likely Wednesday
2017-07-03 12:40:21	lwang	sorry Thursday
2017-07-03 12:40:30	lwang	not Wednesday, Lubos is out on Wednesday
2017-07-03 12:40:47	lwang	we need to give QE a couple more days to see if they run into any issues with RC compose..
2017-07-03 12:40:53	lwang	so we are waiting for a couple more days
2017-07-03 12:41:27	aquini	lwang: and do we have a BZ candidate list? so I can start testing ahead?
2017-07-03 12:41:35	lwang	aquini, however, you are welcome to do a scratch build on the following bzs
2017-07-03 12:41:38	lwang	yes
2017-07-03 12:41:45	lwang	let me give that to you

2017-07-03 12:49:19	aquini	11:39 < lwang> after all that complaining from the HW enablement team and networking team,
2017-07-03 12:49:22	aquini	11:39 < lwang> we are respiing for their patches
2017-07-03 12:50:03	aquini	lwang: ^ now we know why they were crying,  then.
2017-07-03 13:01:21	lwang	why?
2017-07-03 13:01:24	lwang	I don't get it..
2017-07-03 13:06:21	aquini	seems that they would like to push for a crypto revert and thus a forced respin so these patches could take a ride on the respin without being the responsibles by the respin
2017-07-03 13:16:20	aquini	lwang: FYI: I'm starting the scratch-build for that BZ list, but there still are pending questions on patches for bugs 966840 & 1461892.
2017-07-03 13:16:59	lwang	by these patches weren't ready at the time..
2017-07-03 13:17:05	lwang	but these patches weren't ready at the time..

2017-07-03 16:53:24	lwang	aquini, do you when the cpuscalling, turbostat tools got moved to inside the kernel-tools pkg?
2017-07-03 16:53:48	lwang	are they part of kernel-tools upstream?
2017-07-03 16:53:50	lwang	just curious..
2017-07-03 17:28:51	aquini	lwang: lemme check it, I don't have that info on top of my head.
2017-07-03 17:31:15	lwang	aquini, I can't believe Jiri Benc posted a RC resping patch himself.
2017-07-03 17:31:40	lwang	aquini, I like to see " a plan how we can improve the process of catching these memory corruption and memory leak issues ..
2017-07-03 17:31:44	lwang	and ... "
2017-07-03 17:31:53	lwang	Oh mine.. I am so concerned
2017-07-03 17:32:20	 *	lwang puts her hand over her forehead..
2017-07-03 17:32:44	lwang	someone should ask him the same question he asked me..
2017-07-03 17:33:05	lwang	that would be hilarious
2017-07-03 17:33:28	lwang	especially the bug was found by Longman.. whom point it out to him
2017-07-03 17:34:01	lwang	the interesting part is the memory leak issue is 1.2G of memory leak per 100,000 namespace tear down
2017-07-03 17:34:07	lwang	the interesting part is the memory leak issue is 1.2G of memory leak per 100,000 network namespace tear down
2017-07-03 17:34:24	lwang	and they have a NULL ptr deference kernel panic patch that they defer to 7.5
2017-07-03 17:36:04	aquini	lwang: which bug is that? (sorry I was working on analyzing 1373519 -- to help lwoodman a bit)
2017-07-03 17:42:32	aquini	lwang: on that turbostat question: it was inherited from upstream (fedora)
2017-07-03 17:43:54	aquini	this is the change that put it into kenrel-tools pkg:
2017-07-03 17:43:56	aquini	commit 58d1d69e1225aa53ea8303171fbd044cd3181db8

2017-07-05 10:27:45	lwang	do you know which patch enable this config:
2017-07-05 10:27:46	lwang	CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS
2017-07-05 10:27:47	lwang	?
2017-07-05 10:37:37	aquini	lwang: if came enabled from fedora
2017-07-05 10:37:48	lwang	aquini, thanks!
2017-07-05 10:38:03	lwang	aquini, but only on x86_64.. 
2017-07-05 10:38:16	lwang	looks like Jirka enable it on s390x w/ bug 1436323, right?
2017-07-05 10:40:26	aquini	lwang: yes. jolsa just sent a revert for that config on s390
2017-07-05 10:46:22	aquini	lwang: as a matter of fact, we inherited from fedora CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS=y set for the generic setup -- all arches except s390
2017-07-05 10:46:54	aquini	lwang: jolsa changed that s390 diff from other arches with 1436323
2017-07-05 10:47:10	lwang	aquini, *nod* thanks
2017-07-05 10:49:11	aquini	lwang: and he's asking to revert it via 1464697, so the proper fix for the later bz gets soaktime upstream
2017-07-05 10:50:20	aquini	unfortunately, getting that config set on s390 triggered a bug.
2017-07-05 10:51:44	aquini	lwang: is PM going for that respin you mentioned last Monday?
2017-07-05 11:21:21	lwang	hangon still discussing a few blockers..
2017-07-05 11:21:50	aquini	lwang: OK
2017-07-05 13:05:17	lwang	aquini, the list of patches stays at 7
2017-07-05 13:06:00	lwang	they are:
2017-07-05 13:06:18	lwang	1464697 kernel [1600] BLOCKER REGRESSSION POST s390x: Oops: 0004 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC on ftrace enabled system

2017-07-05 13:07:33	lwang	---
2017-07-05 13:08:15	lwang	we are still waiting on test result of 1458687 and peer review acks on 1461892
2017-07-05 13:38:03	aquini	lwang: jbenc mailed me earlier reporting that patches for 1458687 && 1464292 would be OK to go into a respin
2017-07-05 13:38:33	lwang	aquini, well, I don't think he tested it throughly yet
2017-07-05 13:38:46	aquini	lwang: he did not mention the patch for 1461892, though. I don't think he even tested that one given the pending question
2017-07-05 13:39:37	aquini	lwang: just fwd that email to you.
2017-07-05 16:17:49	lwang	aquini, thanks.
2017-07-05 16:17:52	lwang	another patch came in:
2017-07-05 16:17:53	lwang	1346106
2017-07-05 16:18:17	lwang	aquini, bcoddington has tested it against 7.4 nfs.. and seems to work,
2017-07-05 16:18:26	lwang	but we need a bit more testing against 7.4 fips-mode
2017-07-05 16:21:24	aquini	lwang: when the respin compose will happen?
2017-07-05 16:21:36	lwang	aquini, tomorrow night EOB
2017-07-05 16:21:39	lwang	EDT
2017-07-05 16:21:49	lwang	aquini, sorry..
2017-07-05 16:21:51	lwang	wrong info.
2017-07-05 16:22:09	lwang	the respin compose will not happen 'til Monday Noon EDT time
2017-07-05 16:22:25	aquini	Ok
2017-07-05 16:22:28	lwang	however, QE would like to get your kernel early enough to run through tier1 and tier2 testing Friday their time,
2017-07-05 16:22:33	lwang	and Monday their  time.
2017-07-05 16:23:07	lwang	so we likely will have a RC respin kernel candidate ready for them to test tomorrow night 
2017-07-05 16:23:25	lwang	so that development and QE can have a quick run at this kernel before we hand it off to RC respin compose
2017-07-05 16:23:31	lwang	we don't want to respin again
2017-07-05 16:26:47	lwang	that is at least the current plan
2017-07-05 16:27:01	aquini	sounds like a good plan to me
2017-07-05 16:27:11	lwang	I see a bunch patches now posted to rhkernel-list targeted for 7.4
2017-07-05 16:27:22	lwang	as if the door is open now
2017-07-05 16:27:33	aquini	I'm asking 'cause we still have to let room for kenrel-rt re-sync
2017-07-05 16:27:56	aquini	this plan you detailed will work fine for that matter, AFAICS
2017-07-05 16:29:26	lwang	kernel-rt is really a problem. we need to ask rt team to get their rt patches upstream
2017-07-05 16:29:32	lwang	so that we don't have to worry about them
2017-07-05 16:29:40	lwang	have you asked them about their progress?
2017-07-05 16:30:49	aquini	lwang: I believe one of their goals is to get that, so the -rt variant can become a simple config change in the spec file
2017-07-05 16:31:04	lwang	aquini, *nod* when?
2017-07-05 16:31:08	lwang	do they have an ETA?
2017-07-05 16:32:16	aquini	lwang: I don't know if they have an ETA, though.
2017-07-05 16:32:38	lwang	they have been saying that for the last 5 years
2017-07-05 16:32:41	lwang	or more
2017-07-05 16:34:23	lwang	aquini, can you help build a test kernel for Ben/Herbert's patch?
2017-07-05 16:34:33	lwang	need to verify that it doesn't panic during boot
2017-07-05 16:34:44	lwang	in both fip_mode=1 or fip-mode=0
2017-07-05 16:34:55	aquini	lwang: it's scratching as we speak
2017-07-05 16:35:01	lwang	:-) thanks!
2017-07-05 16:45:37	lwang	looks like the kernel panic/memory corruption is off the RC respin list
2017-07-05 16:49:35	aquini	bz1464292?
2017-07-05 16:50:27	aquini	it still shows up as an rc blocker to my bugzilla queries, though.
2017-07-05 16:50:50	lwang	yeah..
2017-07-05 16:50:58	lwang	PM has not taken that off yet
2017-07-05 16:51:18	lwang	likely in the next hour.. 
2017-07-05 16:51:20	lwang	though
2017-07-05 16:51:26	lwang	it will dissapear
2017-07-05 16:52:06	aquini	I'll reconcile the queued-for next patch bundle with blocker list later.
2017-07-05 16:52:31	aquini	so I'll clean up patches for BZs that loose blocker+ flag
2017-07-05 16:53:19	aquini	it's even better having to carry less patches, at this point.
2017-07-05 17:28:58	lwang	ok
2017-07-05 17:29:07	lwang	looks like Ivan's patch got reposted:
2017-07-05 17:29:08	lwang	1461892 180378 ++++P? A-- -- nhorman  [RHEL7.4 PATCH] bonding: Restore old symlink names in sysfs to pr
2017-07-05 17:42:18	aquini	lwang: yes, I have that one in my scratch build, as well
2017-07-05 18:06:55	lwang	aquini, going back.. Jben's memory corruption patch back on..
2017-07-05 18:06:58	lwang	just fyi.
2017-07-05 18:07:58	aquini	lwang: NP
2017-07-05 18:08:13	aquini	had not taken it out of queue yet
2017-07-05 18:09:03	lwang	aquini, just fyi, jbenc is not around 'til Sunday.. so you may have to pick Neil horman's patch up and do the build.
2017-07-05 18:09:15	lwang	if you have the scratch build id for neil's patch, can you let us know?
2017-07-05 18:09:26	lwang	they are going to run the networking test over it..
2017-07-05 18:09:52	lwang	can you also when builindg the officical kernels, before building them, please let us know.
2017-07-05 18:10:32	aquini	lwang: Neil's patch doesn't touch common networking stuff. it only partially revert that troublesome sysfs change for bonding driver
2017-07-05 18:10:35	lwang	we like to get the FS/Sha1-avx2 patch + jben's memory corrpution patch in a separate kernel, the last one if possible..
2017-07-05 18:10:43	lwang	in case either of the patches cause problem.
2017-07-05 18:11:23	lwang	they/netowrking team tests bonding + vlan as well.
2017-07-05 18:11:40	lwang	so if you have a scratch build id.. then I will give it to them.
2017-07-05 18:13:01	aquini	lwang: https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/taskinfo?taskID=13604878
2017-07-05 18:13:41	aquini	that build has all patches in queue-for-next, plus:

2017-07-06 10:54:30	lwang	aquini, pong
2017-07-06 10:54:42	lwang	aquini, any issues?
2017-07-06 10:55:21	aquini	lwang: out of yesterday's patch/BZ just one (minor)
2017-07-06 10:55:38	aquini	BZ 1461892  still missing blocker+ flag
2017-07-06 10:58:17	lwang	ok.. let me pull that up
2017-07-06 10:59:41	lwang	oh.. the sysctrl one.. this is the one we are waiting on jbenc/networking team's testsuite testing result.
2017-07-06 10:59:57	lwang	I can grant it now..
2017-07-06 11:00:15	aquini	lwang: FYI I have to run some errands here. I'll be away for some time -- but I'll be back in time to wrap up and kick off the interim build as planned
2017-07-06 11:01:30	lwang	aquini, sounds good thanks!

2017-07-06 13:41:37	aquini	lwang: I'm back. errands turned out to be quicker than I anticipated.
2017-07-06 13:43:51	--	You are now known as brdeoliv
2017-07-06 13:51:29	lwang	aquini, *nod* Neil's patch is acked by Linville, and it has sushil's team testing/blessing
2017-07-06 13:52:01	lwang	aquini, I was trying to see if Jan is online or not.. probably not, due to Brno holiday
2017-07-06 13:52:29	lwang	aquini, so I am curious to know if you have run any fips-mode related boot up test yet?
2017-07-06 13:56:04	aquini	lwang: I did
2017-07-06 13:56:16	aquini	lwang: all green on my tests
2017-07-06 13:57:39	aquini	lwang: https://beaker.engineering.redhat.com/recipes/4029750#tasks
2017-07-06 14:28:29	lwang	aquini, thanks!
2017-07-06 17:07:21	aquini	lwang: I belive we have everything ready to start building the rc-spin canditade. shall I kick that build now?
2017-07-06 17:28:21	lwang	aquini, go for it
2017-07-06 17:28:30	aquini	lwang: OK
2017-07-06 17:29:03	lwang	aquini, oh
2017-07-06 17:29:41	lwang	just fyi.. can you build a separate kernel with Jbenc's memory corruption patch and sha1-avx2 patch?
2017-07-06 17:29:45	lwang	as the last kernel?
2017-07-06 17:30:21	lwang	mainly because Sushil is extremely leerwary about that patch.. he is afraid further testing will find issues with that patch..
2017-07-06 17:30:34	lwang	since there is no extensive testing and soak time on it..
2017-07-06 17:33:03	aquini	lwang: we could split the, but it's just extra work, IMO. if any issue pops up with those patches we _WILL_ have to revert them before branching 7.5
2017-07-06 17:33:46	lwang	aquini, *nod* but at least we don't have to wait for the revert, and compose can happen continousely
2017-07-06 17:33:54	lwang	with the earlier version of the kernel#
2017-07-06 17:34:12	lwang	right?
2017-07-06 17:35:08	lwang	can't RCM branch the 7.5 based on the earlier version?
2017-07-06 17:35:18	aquini	nope
2017-07-06 17:35:31	lwang	even though we have already used up the version#?
2017-07-06 17:35:47	lwang	I know they can help cancel the un-wanted nvr..
2017-07-06 17:36:14	lwang	hmm..
2017-07-06 17:36:32	lwang	we need to have a talk with RCM
2017-07-06 17:36:53	lwang	are you sure?
2017-07-06 17:36:58	lwang	have you asked them before?
2017-07-06 17:37:11	aquini	if we do, lets say 692.el7 and 693.el7, and for any reason we decide that 693.el7 will not make GA, we have to revert patches for the last build in a subsequent build
2017-07-06 17:38:21	lwang	but can they branched on 692.el7? 
2017-07-06 17:38:43	lwang	and once they branched, then 693.el7 is built based on the new branch..
2017-07-06 17:38:44	aquini	that's because we'll have 693.el7 build committed to both trees master trunk, and there's no way we can get back from that
2017-07-06 17:39:02	lwang	hmm. that's true
2017-07-06 17:39:15	aquini	we only go foward, once we commit to master trunk
2017-07-06 17:39:37	lwang	can they remove a nvr commit from master trunk?
2017-07-06 17:40:02	lwang	or how bout.. 7.4 GAs with 692.el7.
2017-07-06 17:40:25	lwang	7.5 branched on 692.el7, but start building with 694.el7... or
2017-07-06 17:40:39	lwang	7.5 branched on 694el7, and continue building from there..
2017-07-06 17:41:00	lwang	becuase i don't think anyone ever look at the beginning of an update's nvr..
2017-07-06 17:41:38	lwang	and the changelog will have the history of 693/694 <- which is the revert
2017-07-06 17:41:47	aquini	it doesn't work like that, unfortunately. the way git tree is used, we can only do fast-forwarding merges.
2017-07-06 17:42:01	lwang	but this is branching
2017-07-06 17:42:10	lwang	I am not asking to stop moveing forward..
2017-07-06 17:42:19	lwang	I am asking to branch at a different point
2017-07-06 17:42:48	lwang	then the GA kernel nvr
2017-07-06 17:43:42	lwang	unless they have to branch based on the GA nvr tag.
2017-07-06 17:44:22	aquini	for dist-git that would work, as the branching goes as branches...
2017-07-06 17:44:38	aquini	the problem is the git.app tree, where we do not branch
2017-07-06 17:44:46	lwang	ah
2017-07-06 17:46:08	aquini	so, if we split the builds, and nothing goes south, nothing changes...
2017-07-06 17:47:25	aquini	but if the patches are troublesome, for any reason, we'll be forced to shipt a 3rd build to revert them and pick that last one as the RC/GA
2017-07-06 17:47:53	aquini	humm
2017-07-06 17:48:09	aquini	that might work, actually.
2017-07-06 17:48:19	lwang	no time
2017-07-06 17:48:34	aquini	no, I mean splitting the builds
2017-07-06 17:48:56	lwang	you lost me
2017-07-06 17:49:21	aquini	:) (sorry, I did not mean to lost you)
2017-07-06 17:50:05	aquini	I'm giving it a second thought here. the problem I thought we sould have on git.app is not a bit problem, 
2017-07-06 17:50:25	aquini	the real problem is with dist-git, though.
2017-07-06 17:51:43	aquini	we have to make sure RCM can do the branch for 7.5 in the split point, if we need to ship the earlier kernel instead of the latest
2017-07-06 17:54:09	aquini	RCM just need to be sure they can  make 7.4 branch stays with, lets say 692.el7, and 7.5 branch picks up 693.el7 as its base
2017-07-06 17:54:46	aquini	the oter part (git.app) will just take a manual tag adjust I'll have to perform to reflect that.
2017-07-06 17:57:27	lwang	yeah.. can you remind me again what does git.app do?
2017-07-06 17:58:18	lwang	and how it is getting updated from dist-git? 
2017-07-06 17:58:26	aquini	lwang: git.app is where we keep the real source tree for the kernel. dist-git just keeps the artifacts for rpm build reproduceability
2017-07-06 18:00:36	aquini	lwang: every build committed on dist-git comes from a bundle of patches committed into git.app for the same N-V-R
2017-07-06 18:01:26	lwang	is srpm check into the dist-git?
2017-07-06 18:01:36	aquini	lwang: yes
2017-07-06 18:02:42	aquini	lwang: dist-git keeps the adjusted spec file and source files due to the RPM generation, for each N-V-R
2017-07-06 18:03:42	aquini	lwang: git.app keeps the code changes that produce those aforementioned artifacts (kernel.spec, linux-source tarball, abi symbol lists, ...)
2017-07-06 18:04:11	@aris	aquini, this was made in the past without issues
2017-07-06 18:04:18	@aris	you have version A, version B
2017-07-06 18:04:28	@aris	B is a tentative with a patch that isn't sure we'll get in
2017-07-06 18:04:37	@aris	both go through the entire process
2017-07-06 18:05:08	@aris	B fails, A is shipped, they fork from A to zstream
2017-07-06 18:05:18	@aris	main branch gets C, reverting B
2017-07-06 18:05:40	lwang	aris, except RCM changed the branching policy.. 
2017-07-06 18:05:55	lwang	they fork from A to continue with the main branch
2017-07-06 18:06:06	@aris	sigh
2017-07-06 18:06:08	@aris	well
2017-07-06 18:06:15	@aris	zstream can revert B in that case
2017-07-06 18:06:23	@aris	it doesn't matter really
2017-07-06 18:06:28	lwang	*nod* 
2017-07-06 18:06:50	aquini	aris: problem is that there's no main branch usage in dist-git, they branch out 7.5 from what we have in 7.4
2017-07-06 18:06:54	@aris	we can build whatever we want on dist-git and it'll never see the light of day unless we tag it into something that will turn into a compose
2017-07-06 18:07:07	@aris	right
2017-07-06 18:07:12	@aris	but what stays is zstream
2017-07-06 18:07:21	@aris	they can revert B and start from there
2017-07-06 18:07:25	@aris	just need communication
2017-07-06 18:08:16	@aris	interesting change
2017-07-06 18:08:19	@aris	wondering what's behind it
2017-07-06 18:08:23	aquini	if RCM cannot branch into that split point, letting A to z-stream (7.4) and B to y-stream (7.5) in dist-git, then we have a problem
2017-07-06 18:09:01	@aris	let's say they branch on HEAD
2017-07-06 18:09:07	@aris	you get B
2017-07-06 18:09:17	@aris	B is never shipped because the rpm was never tagged
2017-07-06 18:09:23	@aris	you revert B, done
2017-07-06 18:09:38	@aris	if they fork from A, zstream folks revert B
2017-07-06 18:09:43	@aris	if, for some reason
2017-07-06 18:10:03	@aris	they fork from A and remove everything else, forcing zstream to also start with A, there's no problem
2017-07-06 18:10:18	@aris	the key point here is: doesn't matter what's on dist-git
2017-07-06 18:10:23	@aris	what gets shipped is what's tagged
2017-07-06 18:10:36	aquini	and that's where you're missing the issue
2017-07-06 18:10:38	@aris	if you never tag B into rhel-7.4-candidate, that rpm never goes out
2017-07-06 18:11:16	aquini	they cannot get rid of B on dist-git (make it vanish), without also making it vanish from git.app
2017-07-06 18:11:59	aquini	once B is in dist-git, it also is on git.app.
2017-07-06 18:12:05	@aris	remember that you don't push to git.app until the kernel is released?
2017-07-06 18:12:20	@aris	during embargo?
2017-07-06 18:12:25	@aris	you do the same
2017-07-06 18:12:45	@aris	it's not the standard procedure
2017-07-06 18:13:05	@aris	but the whole thing is an exception anyway
2017-07-06 18:13:42	aquini	in this picture, you're not considering that the issues lwang refers to might show up after the kernel gets released ,but before we start the compose
2017-07-06 18:14:32	aquini	so you have both A and B fully committed
2017-07-06 18:14:42	@aris	if this is GA
2017-07-06 18:14:51	@aris	there's no time for it
2017-07-06 18:14:58	@aris	and that'd be something we never done before
2017-07-06 18:15:25	@aris	with that in mind we can simply go cherry picking kernels back in time
2017-07-06 18:15:32	@aris	even if there's no gamble
2017-07-06 18:15:38	@aris	someone finds out that -900 has a problem
2017-07-06 18:15:43	@aris	way way late in the game
2017-07-06 18:15:49	@aris	instead of 0 day
2017-07-06 18:15:53	@aris	through zstream
2017-07-06 18:15:58	@aris	you go and pick 899
2017-07-06 18:16:09	@aris	we never did this before
2017-07-06 18:16:11	@aris	and if we do
2017-07-06 18:16:23	@aris	RCM better make it work on their enbd
2017-07-06 18:16:29	@aris	because it's not just an issue for us
2017-07-06 18:16:33	@aris	it'll be for everyone else
2017-07-06 18:16:43	@aris	after released, you have BZs closed
2017-07-06 18:17:08	@aris	you have to revert all that manually and "lose" a version or two
2017-07-06 18:17:32	@aris	IOW, if something like this happens, it's new and RCM needs to play ball on their side as well
2017-07-06 18:17:51	@aris	even if they don't
2017-07-06 18:18:05	@aris	you can simply have a reverted version C on git.app
2017-07-06 18:18:13	aquini	aris: that's why I started stating that it would be extra work splitting the builds in this scenario. any problem with any build will mandate a revert in a subsequent build, to keep things flowing as designated by the current process
2017-07-06 18:18:15	@aris	you overwrite everything anyway in rhel7
2017-07-06 18:18:21	@aris	it's a tarball
2017-07-06 18:18:41	@aris	so dist-git will simply lack version B
2017-07-06 18:18:53	aquini	anything outside the ordinary scritp will require sync with other teams and RCM support
2017-07-06 18:18:55	@aris	and that can be documented as needed
2017-07-06 18:19:07	@aris	of course
2017-07-06 18:22:14	aquini	lwang: the key here, to avoid headaches is RCM being able to branch out 7.5 in an arbitrary commit of current 7.4 branch
2017-07-06 18:23:04	lwang	sigh lets just hope that Jiri Benc's patch is good
2017-07-06 18:23:06	aquini	this way we avoid having to perform reverts on 7.4 z-stream, or git history overwrites
2017-07-06 18:24:13	lwang	but it is better than pulling it into a single kernel.. and cause havoc with RC respin and GA schedule
2017-07-06 18:24:18	aquini	if RCM cannot do that, I'd say it's better to not split the builds, and if anything go wrong with jbenc's patches we revert them in a subsequent build
2017-07-06 18:24:34	lwang	I don't think we will get an answer from RCM today
2017-07-06 18:24:48	lwang	can you build them?
2017-07-06 18:24:51	aquini	I'm quite sure those two build will be released by KGTT, given the test results we have
2017-07-06 18:25:00	lwang	k
2017-07-06 18:25:06	lwang	lets do it
2017-07-06 18:25:40	lwang	I think either way, if it fails testing, then we will have to deal with the consequence whatever that might be
2017-07-06 18:25:41	aquini	lwang: just to double check: you want to go with 2 separate builds ?
2017-07-06 18:25:54	lwang	*nod* that is what I told Sushil to ease his worry
2017-07-06 18:26:01	lwang	if you can.. please
2017-07-06 18:26:11	@aris	are both parts troublesome?
2017-07-06 18:26:25	@aris	i.e. can A be bad but patches in B good?
2017-07-06 18:26:40	lwang	if RCM can't do what we thought they can do before, then it is no worst than what we have to deal with
2017-07-06 18:26:45	lwang	as a single kernel.
2017-07-06 18:27:07	lwang	aris, :-) it is possible.
2017-07-06 18:27:54	@aris	ugh
2017-07-06 18:27:57	lwang	aris, and we don't have plan for that.. the result will likely be as bad as single kernel..
2017-07-06 18:28:00	aquini	lwang: I'd go simpler, with one build. and if patches proven to be bad, revert them later. I think it's safer as well, as the action to recover from that is just revert patches.
2017-07-06 18:28:27	lwang	either way its time that we are trying to conserve
2017-07-06 18:28:32	lwang	not build#
2017-07-06 18:29:02	lwang	aquini, let me guess, you have already kick off the build with all the patches?
2017-07-06 18:29:16	aquini	lwang: no, I yet have not.
2017-07-06 18:29:17	lwang	or at least prepare them or commit them 
2017-07-06 18:29:53	aquini	lwang: I have them all ready to go, but did not kicked the build.
2017-07-06 18:30:01	lwang	ok.. can we do two builds if you don't mind the extra work?
2017-07-06 18:30:28	lwang	because if there is anything wrong with 2nd kernel.. at least I can use this as an example and ask RCM to see what they can do for us
2017-07-06 18:30:52	lwang	to save time in this case.
2017-07-06 18:31:10	aquini	lwang: ok, your call. 
2017-07-06 18:31:11	lwang	otherwise, either way, the worst case is to respin the RC respin kernel
2017-07-06 18:31:34	lwang	likely to move out the GA date
2017-07-06 18:31:42	@aris	you both deserve company paid 2 week cruise after 7.4
2017-07-06 18:31:44	lwang	doesn' t look like we have much option
2017-07-06 18:32:29	lwang	:-) you can take that for me..
2017-07-06 18:32:37	lwang	we have pegas coming up
2017-07-06 18:33:21	lwang	or give it to aquini 
2017-07-06 18:33:30	lwang	he deserves all that time off
2017-07-06 18:42:08	@aris	ack
2017-07-06 18:42:11	@aris	:)
2017-07-06 18:42:14	--	aris is now known as aris_out
2017-07-06 18:45:14	aquini	lwang: just to double check, before I start building, could you refresh the status page and check out the 2 bundles?
2017-07-06 18:45:43	aquini	lwang: queued for next will be 692.el7 and pipeline will become 693.el7
2017-07-06 18:47:35	lwang	k pulling the page up
2017-07-06 18:48:04	lwang	ack

2017-07-13 15:32:57	lwang	*nod* thanks!
2017-07-13 15:33:10	lwang	I will use it to update the stats chart:
2017-07-13 15:34:17	@aquini	lwang: if you need more stats, let me know. I can adjust the scritps to get them reported.
2017-07-13 15:34:39	@aris	aquini, I think what boils down to is: do you want to do 8.0
2017-07-13 15:35:26	@aris	because of how deadlines are aligned, 7.5 then 8.0 will be a massive amount of work by itself, not counting the amount of time you're under pressure
2017-07-13 15:36:49	@aris	you swap to pegas, you get to understand how it works (and how the new model with devel tree will work for rhel)
2017-07-13 15:37:17	@aris	herton gets ystream experience
2017-07-13 15:37:36	@aris	in the end both will be seasoned on both
2017-07-13 15:38:35	@aris	and because pegas has way less volume than 7.5 and it's a different thing, it'll help you "rest" from rhel7 for a bit
2017-07-13 15:38:42	@aris	then go back to 8.0
2017-07-13 15:39:49	@aris	you two are amazing maintainers and we can all agree we don't want any of you to burn out
2017-07-13 15:42:49	@aquini	aris: yeah, I get that. and swapping probably is a good way to ensure both of us gets experience on the two different beasts we have to cope with.
2017-07-13 15:43:10	@aquini	sounds like a win-win plan

2017-07-14 11:40:45	@aris	ok
2017-07-14 11:41:28	@brdeoliv	and as I said you earlier, I don't know whether this is the VM or not to be used with the testcase
2017-07-14 11:41:49	@brdeoliv	do you know?
2017-07-14 11:42:50	@aris	I've used crimson in the past for the testing
2017-07-14 11:43:52	@brdeoliv	ah, nice then. I think Tomas will be the one to contact to authorize your ssh key, if you don't have it
2017-07-14 11:44:56	@aris	I haven't yet
2017-07-14 11:51:16	@brdeoliv	aris: I just sent you the email with Stephan's testsuite attached

2017-07-14 12:01:55	@brdeoliv	aris: do you remember the first email lwang sent to Stephan requesting the testsuite? you were cc'ed
2017-07-14 12:02:32	lwang_	aris, let me dig that up.. I believe it is on one of the FIPS page.
2017-07-14 12:02:38	lwang_	brdeoliv, hold off on sending that email
2017-07-14 12:02:54	lwang_	brdeoliv, I don't want to trigger any more urgency from them
2017-07-14 12:03:24	@brdeoliv	lwang_: ah yes, I won't send 
2017-07-14 12:04:14	@brdeoliv	that email has the first version of Stephan's testsuite, which might be necessary to Aris
2017-07-14 12:05:00	lwang_	aris, https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1131369-rhel-74-fips-testing-platforms
2017-07-14 12:05:16	@brdeoliv	there is the kmod which enables the /sys/crypto interface
2017-07-14 12:05:19	lwang_	try test redhat
2017-07-14 12:12:27	@aris	lwang_, from those, 1 is offline, 1 is performing tests and the others have very outdated RHEL7 installs
2017-07-14 12:13:30	lwang_	aris, I wonder why they are offline, and outdated..
2017-07-14 12:13:43	lwang_	do you know which version of RHEL7 is running on that last system?
2017-07-14 12:13:52	@aris	lwang_, for the kernel I always used two different ones
2017-07-14 12:13:58	@aris	one of them is crimson
2017-07-14 12:14:09	@aris	I've sent an email to tmraz asking for access to them
2017-07-14 12:14:11	lwang_	yes. I remember that machine.. 
2017-07-14 12:14:20	@aris	I'll perform the tests there
2017-07-14 12:14:35	lwang_	I think it is the IBM one that we should be using
2017-07-14 12:14:37	@aris	all the times I did CAVS testing it was on tmraz' machines
2017-07-14 12:14:42	@aris	right
2017-07-14 12:14:57	@aris	so for the others, I'd guess they're for userspace testing
2017-07-14 12:14:58	lwang_	these are not tmarz's machine
2017-07-14 12:15:06	lwang_	he is safekeeping them
2017-07-14 12:15:32	lwang_	because we don't have the resource to mgt these.. the QE lady that supposes to handle all of these..
2017-07-14 12:15:49	lwang_	whom I introduced you to, a while back, is no longer here at RH
2017-07-14 12:16:28	lwang_	QE supposes to hire someone replacing her, and that got yanked the last minute last year
2017-07-14 12:16:53	@aris	right, I mean the machines he always pointed me to use
2017-07-14 12:16:54	lwang_	now, they suppose to hire someone this year.. the july 11 person, I have to find out where this new QE guy is located
2017-07-14 12:17:04	lwang_	right.. those are supposed to be managed by us
2017-07-14 12:17:11	@aris	he seems the person taking care of the machines, didn't mean it was his property or anything
2017-07-14 12:17:20	lwang_	got it
2017-07-14 12:18:47	lwang_	these systmes should be in beaker here downstairs
2017-07-14 12:21:29	@aris	hopefully tmraz is not out already
2017-07-14 12:23:49	lwang_	he might be. cc'ing Jaroslav
2017-07-14 12:23:54	lwang_	he is always online..
2017-07-14 12:23:59	lwang_	Jaroslav is the PM
2017-07-14 12:39:56	lwang_	aris, darn! jjreznik is gone too.. 
2017-07-14 12:40:01	@aris	argh
2017-07-14 12:40:02	lwang_	at 11:11 
2017-07-14 12:40:02	@aris	ok
2017-07-14 12:40:21	@aris	I'll wait for bruno to be back and will ask him to simply replace his key with mine
2017-07-14 12:40:29	lwang_	it is likely all the folks whom is doing FIPS will know the password.. 
2017-07-14 12:40:42	lwang_	like libnss, and etc..
2017-07-14 12:41:06	@aris	it seems authentication is done now by ssh key
2017-07-14 12:41:09	@aris	not password
2017-07-14 12:41:30	@aris	Bruno mentioned he had to give a public key for Tomas to set up his access
2017-07-14 12:41:46	lwang_	i think rrelyea@REDHAT.COM would know
2017-07-14 12:42:19	lwang_	you kidding me?
2017-07-14 12:42:23	lwang_	public key? 
2017-07-14 12:42:37	@aris	?
2017-07-14 12:42:44	lwang_	I guess they don't want any random people reserve these machines from beaker
2017-07-14 12:43:10	@aris	they just don't want to keep weak password for these accounts
2017-07-14 12:43:25	@aris	nobody can reserve that machine from beaker unless they allow it in beaker
2017-07-14 12:43:40	@aris	it's just stepping up the security a bit on it, which is fair considering the machine is important
2017-07-14 12:44:12	lwang_	hmm... what does that say about the rest of the systems on the RH's backbone?
2017-07-14 12:44:47	@aris	well, beaker for example has huge random generated passwords that are replaced often
2017-07-14 12:44:54	@aris	no more 100yard-
2017-07-14 12:45:03	lwang_	*nod*
2017-07-14 12:45:26	lwang_	so generate a set of password and pass that onto those whom are involved in the FIPS
2017-07-14 12:45:48	lwang_	adding individual public key as way to get in, and no one outside Brno knows, or can do..
2017-07-14 12:45:50	lwang_	is limiting.
2017-07-14 12:45:59	@aris	agreed
2017-07-14 12:46:32	lwang_	and this supposes to be "urgent" according to tmraz's email
2017-07-14 12:46:56	lwang_	seriousely?
2017-07-14 12:47:59	lwang_	they need to stop yanking our chain.. 
2017-07-14 12:49:24	lwang_	dumping requirements that are listed as part of FIPS cert at the last minute on us
2017-07-14 12:49:32	lwang_	dumping requirements that are _NOT_ listed as part of FIPS cert at the last minute on us
2017-07-14 13:52:49	@brdeoliv	aris: try to login on crimaon360
2017-07-14 13:53:10	@brdeoliv	crimson360*
2017-07-14 13:53:40	@aris	brdeoliv, did you overwrite your public key?
2017-07-14 13:53:57	@brdeoliv	no, added yours
2017-07-14 13:54:51	@brdeoliv	would be better just overwrties mine? since tmraz is safekeeping it
2017-07-14 13:55:28	@brdeoliv	holly .. my "big" fingers.. overwrite*
2017-07-14 13:55:42	@aris	no, no worries
2017-07-14 13:55:52	@aris	I didn't know you could have more than one, that's all
2017-07-14 13:56:00	@brdeoliv	ok
2017-07-14 13:57:19	@aris	just a sec and I'll try it
2017-07-14 13:57:32	@brdeoliv	ah ok
2017-07-14 14:03:32	@aris	works
2017-07-14 14:03:43	@aris	root access?
2017-07-14 14:03:59	@aris	ah,  no need
2017-07-14 14:08:35	@brdeoliv	nice
2017-07-14 14:22:55	@aris	lwang_, I'm going to do something risky here
2017-07-14 14:23:17	@aris	crimson380 is using 7.1
2017-07-14 14:23:23	@aris	I'll update it to 7.4
2017-07-14 14:24:14	lwang_	:-)
2017-07-14 14:24:30	@aris	I mean, the ideal would be wait for Tomas
2017-07-14 14:24:38	@aris	but we don't have a lot of time, do we
2017-07-14 14:24:59	lwang_	well, according to him, no
2017-07-14 14:25:09	lwang_	plus, 7.1 was the last time we did FIPS cert..
2017-07-14 14:25:25	lwang_	so if you check "last".. I'll bet that no one log on since
2017-07-14 14:26:09	lwang_	well, according to him, no _time_
2017-07-14 14:40:18	 *	aris goes get another liter of hot water for his chimarrao while this thing upgrades
2017-07-14 14:45:16	@brdeoliv	aris :D
2017-07-14 15:02:31	@aris	argh
2017-07-14 15:02:34	@aris	I upgraded it
2017-07-14 15:02:39	@aris	rebooted into the new kernel
2017-07-14 15:02:45	@aris	ssh: connect to host crimson380.lab.bos.redhat.com port 22: Connection refused
2017-07-14 15:10:10	lwang	oops
2017-07-14 15:11:10	@aris	yep, dead
2017-07-14 15:12:38	lwang	do you want me to ask someone here to see if we can get into the console?
2017-07-14 15:13:15	lwang	I can go find someone from devops upstairs...
2017-07-14 15:13:39	lwang	to get into the lab..
2017-07-14 15:19:38	@aris	lwang, if you cold do that would save the day
2017-07-14 15:19:50	@aris	otherwise we're locked out until tmraz is back
2017-07-14 15:19:52	lwang	let me go find geroge
2017-07-14 15:20:18	lwang	do you remember the name of machine?
2017-07-14 15:20:43	@aris	crimson380.lab.bos.redhat.com
2017-07-14 15:20:44	lwang	it is probably here on the chat room here.
2017-07-14 15:21:10	lwang	aris, ok be right back
2017-07-14 15:42:00	lwang	aris, ping
2017-07-14 15:42:04	lwang	aris, so the machine is up..
2017-07-14 15:42:09	lwang	we see the console login..
2017-07-14 15:42:18	lwang	however, the typical root pw combination didn't work
2017-07-14 15:42:27	lwang	so I am going back downstairs, 
2017-07-14 15:42:53	lwang	oh.. hmm.. I wonder the upgrade blase away the passwd file
2017-07-14 15:43:01	lwang	s/blase/blast/
2017-07-14 15:43:31	lwang	anyhow, we can try one more thing..
2017-07-14 15:43:47	lwang	at the console, we can type in your login and passwd.. and see if we can get in..
2017-07-14 15:43:53	lwang	that is another option
2017-07-14 15:44:01	lwang	aris, do you want to try that?
2017-07-14 15:44:38	lwang	aris, hello?
2017-07-14 15:45:08	lwang	I can't get into the lab, and george is waiting by the door.. so I need to know..
2017-07-14 15:45:15	lwang	hello?
2017-07-14 15:45:24	@aris	lwang, yes, sorry
2017-07-14 15:45:38	@aris	the upgrade shouldn't have done that
2017-07-14 15:45:40	lwang	ok.. I will get my phone and text you..
2017-07-14 15:45:46	@aris	but it's likely they have a different password
2017-07-14 15:45:48	lwang	when I get back in
2017-07-14 15:46:08	@aris	the user is eal but we don't have a password
2017-07-14 15:46:11	@aris	nor root password
2017-07-14 15:46:24	@aris	we log using certificate login then /bin/su - asks no password
2017-07-14 15:47:03	@aris	something to try:
2017-07-14 15:47:08	@aris	reboot the machine and boot the old kernel
2017-07-14 15:47:19	@aris	3.10.0-229.11.1.el7
2017-07-14 15:47:24	@aris	see if it works
2017-07-14 16:22:32	@aris	it'd be interesting to know why booting with fips=1 would not work
2017-07-14 16:22:39	@aris	this is latest rhel-7.4
2017-07-14 16:25:16	@aris	:q
2017-07-14 16:33:06	@brdeoliv	aris: did you boot as fips-mode? wow.
2017-07-14 16:34:19	@aris	no
2017-07-14 16:34:22	@aris	had to disable it
2017-07-14 16:34:44	@aris	now trying to build the freaking thing
2017-07-14 16:34:54	@aris	apparently we have a too old version of gcrypt in rhel
2017-07-14 16:35:13	@brdeoliv	yea. indeed, I had to install it by hand
2017-07-14 16:37:29	@aris	I'm using other frontend though
2017-07-14 16:37:32	@aris	kernel module one
2017-07-14 16:42:47	@brdeoliv	that one seems to be outdated
2017-07-14 16:43:11	@brdeoliv	wait, you meant the one sent by stpehan on the first email to linda?
2017-07-14 16:43:24	@aris	no
2017-07-14 16:43:31	@aris	you can pick which one on Makefile
2017-07-14 16:47:07	@brdeoliv	aris: ahh right. I also got confused at first, kcapi (kmod one) using libgcrypt
2017-07-14 16:51:58	@aris	brdeoliv, I don't see the vectors anywhere
2017-07-14 16:52:56	@brdeoliv	aris: the KC_API_Trail .zip file must be extracted into a 'testvectors' folder inside parser folder
2017-07-14 16:53:38	@brdeoliv	unzip -d parser/testvectors/ KC_API...zip
2017-07-14 16:53:57	@aris	ok
2017-07-14 16:54:10	@brdeoliv	btw, this zip file is inside eal user home folder on crinsom machine
2017-07-14 16:54:16	@aris	hm
2017-07-14 16:54:29	@aris	the parser you gave me has no 'testvectors' in it
2017-07-14 16:55:05	@brdeoliv	yea, it has about 115MB
2017-07-14 16:55:06	@aris	and on that machine only 7.1 test vectors exist
2017-07-14 16:55:12	@aris	please take a look on your emails
2017-07-14 16:56:18	@brdeoliv	tmraz said "KC_API_Trial_20170510.zip" are the most recent testvectors
2017-07-14 16:58:14	@brdeoliv	what I meant is that the file "KC_API_Trial_20170510.zip" inside eal@crimson380 home folder is the most recent
2017-07-14 16:59:31	@aris	ah
2017-07-14 16:59:32	@aris	that one
2017-07-14 17:03:06	@aris	brdeoliv, now missing piece is the latest kcapi_cavs driver
2017-07-14 17:03:20	@aris	did Stephan gave you that? or perhaps a github link?
2017-07-14 17:03:35	@brdeoliv	aris: stephan, in the first email he sent to linda
2017-07-14 17:03:45	@brdeoliv	I can send you, easier
2017-07-14 17:05:34	@brdeoliv	aris: sent
2017-07-14 17:05:54	@aris	thanks
2017-07-14 17:06:18	@aris	2015?!?
2017-07-14 17:07:24	@brdeoliv	aris: yes, :/ or the driver didn't was updated since than or stephan sent us the wrong one
2017-07-14 17:08:14	@brdeoliv	wasn't*
2017-07-14 17:09:38	@brdeoliv	btw, I got some errors while compiling this driver, regarding some calls not present or different on RHEL7.4 kernel
2017-07-14 17:16:20	@brdeoliv	aris: look at your email again.. in fact I sent the wrong file sorry
2017-07-14 17:16:56	@aris	didn't arrive yet
2017-07-14 17:18:44	@brdeoliv	nothing yet?
2017-07-14 17:19:48	@aris	got it
2017-07-14 17:20:56	@brdeoliv	ok
2017-07-14 17:24:27	@aris	now it makes more sense
2017-07-14 17:25:59	@brdeoliv	yeah
2017-07-14 17:26:57	@aris	brdeoliv, where are the fixes to build the module? I got the definitions needed but not the rest
2017-07-14 17:28:36	@brdeoliv	aris: I made one but it isn't official at all
2017-07-14 17:29:12	@aris	send the patch my way please
2017-07-14 17:29:37	@brdeoliv	but it is a simple one, let's say that is one just "to run"
2017-07-14 17:29:39	@brdeoliv	one sec
2017-07-14 17:33:31	@brdeoliv	aris: sent
2017-07-14 17:34:16	@aris	already got it
2017-07-14 17:34:27	@aris	included two -helper.c that exist upstream inside the driver
2017-07-14 17:35:20	@aris	finally
2017-07-14 17:35:22	@aris	running
2017-07-14 17:35:41	@aris	I was already attempting to use his libkcapi thing that exist on github
2017-07-14 17:35:55	@aris	and doing all the patching to make it work with the libraries we have in rhel7
2017-07-14 17:36:02	@aris	when you found out the right version
2017-07-14 17:36:02	@aris	phew
2017-07-14 17:36:17	@brdeoliv	:D
2017-07-14 17:38:20	@brdeoliv	which -help.c files did you added?
2017-07-14 17:38:48	@aris	crypto/ecdh_helper.c
2017-07-14 17:38:51	@aris	crypto/dh_helper.c
2017-07-14 17:38:53	@aris	from upstream
2017-07-14 17:39:07	@aris	sigh
2017-07-14 17:39:13	@brdeoliv	ah right :D 
2017-07-14 17:39:15	@aris	driver returns _EEXIST_ to a _read_
2017-07-14 17:40:38	@brdeoliv	something related to AES GCM?
2017-07-14 17:41:00	@aris	sec, lemme get the exact name

2017-07-14 17:46:46	@brdeoliv	but I didn't had time to check before linda's call 
2017-07-14 17:57:02	@aris	well
2017-07-14 17:57:13	@aris	I did changed the script to not stop the test if there's an error
2017-07-14 17:57:29	@aris	and will submit what we have and ask stephan on the same email about stuff that failed and see what we can do
2017-07-14 17:57:40	@aris	it's too late for stephan to respond today
2017-07-14 17:57:47	@aris	so at least we get something out
2017-07-14 18:03:40	@brdeoliv	RIGHT
2017-07-14 18:03:52	@brdeoliv	oops, sorry caps lock
2017-07-14 18:18:07	@brdeoliv	aris: when the script calls this line that returned error, the KCAPI_GCM_AES variable is set using a call to iiv_name function
2017-07-14 18:18:52	@brdeoliv	aris: this function checks the kernel version.. case it is greater than 4.2 the KCAPI_GCM_AES is changed to another value
2017-07-14 18:19:10	@brdeoliv	just to check I changed the 4.2 to 3.10 an the reran the test:

2017-07-14 18:19:37	@brdeoliv	no errors 
2017-07-14 18:19:58	@aris	aha
2017-07-14 18:19:59	@aris	awesome
2017-07-14 18:20:10	@brdeoliv	since this testsuite was made with upstream in mind some backport might change this "peace of code"
2017-07-14 18:20:29	@brdeoliv	I mean, where it is actually handled
2017-07-14 18:21:59	@aris	running again
2017-07-14 18:24:23	@brdeoliv	I thought it could happen once I got almost the same behavior when compiling the kcapi_cavs driver, because of that I added some ifdefs on the "configuration" part 
2017-07-14 18:32:18	@brdeoliv	aris: what exactly happen with all of these inconsistent results?
2017-07-14 18:32:33	@brdeoliv	aris: I mean, what is the procedure/process to handle them?
2017-07-14 18:34:20	@aris	basically shouldnb't happen
2017-07-14 18:34:27	@aris	either kernel bug or something with the test
2017-07-14 18:37:39	@brdeoliv	right :/

2017-07-14 18:39:51	@brdeoliv	well, it's time to go. 
2017-07-14 18:40:01	@brdeoliv	have a nice weekend
2017-07-14 18:40:43	@aris	you too
2017-07-14 18:40:54	@brdeoliv	thanks

2017-07-14 19:10:51	@aris	lwang, sent an email to stephen, you're cc'd
2017-07-14 19:11:06	lwang_	aris, how does it look?
2017-07-14 19:11:14	@aris	23 errors
2017-07-14 19:11:24	@aris	not sure if it's the testing script or kernel
2017-07-14 19:11:32	lwang_	heh..  probably the kernel
2017-07-14 19:11:41	lwang_	I am sure that is what Stephen will say ;-)
2017-07-14 19:12:17	lwang_	you probably should also cc Herbert

2017-07-17 09:55:25	aris	[19:14:09] that won't do because it won't test the new algorithms, no?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	lwang_	[19:15:44] what new algorithms?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	lwang_	[19:15:51] we didn't add any except probably 1
2017-07-17 09:55:25	lwang_	[19:17:14] cc Herbert
2017-07-17 09:55:25	aris	[19:17:28] I did forward the email to him already
2017-07-17 09:55:25	lwang_	[19:18:00] why forward?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	lwang_	[19:18:10] include him in the discussion from Stephen
2017-07-17 09:55:25	lwang_	[19:18:34] he needs to know right a way so that he can submit patches upstream to fix any breakage
2017-07-17 09:55:25	aris	[19:19:46] done
2017-07-17 09:55:25	lwang_	[19:19:51] thanks!
2017-07-17 09:55:25	aris_out	[19:42:51] I'm running the old version right now aswell, will submit the results once it's done

2017-07-17 10:39:39	aris	herton, welcome back
2017-07-17 10:40:11	aris	I suggest to copy the bundles I have and look on 'queue' bundle in specific, I ran a test build/kt1 with it
2017-07-17 10:40:49	aris	there're some discussion around changing "PEGAS PATCH" to "RHEL-7*-ALT"
2017-07-17 10:41:28	aris	I implemented a regex to match both and deferred the decision/email on the change to you
2017-07-17 10:41:37	herton	aris, thanks
2017-07-17 10:42:19	herton	aris, ok, did you change anything else? I'll just start processing patches again, and copy your queue, let me see here
2017-07-17 10:48:05	aris	I didn't do any official builds, just processed patches
2017-07-17 11:00:48	lwang	herton, welcome back too.. just been asked when we will start building pegas kernel
2017-07-17 11:01:06	herton	lwang, I will do a build today
2017-07-17 11:01:11	lwang	herton, thanks
2017-07-17 11:02:04	herton	lwang, just checking the patch queues here, I'll first build a kernel with patches aris processed and did a kt1, then looking at the rest
2017-07-17 11:03:41	lwang	herton, i hope we won't get too many merge conflicts with recent patchsets..
2017-07-17 11:03:53	lwang	herton, thanks

2017-07-17 13:03:22	lwang_	aris, no worries..  I don't think there are that many patches and they don't normally overlap
2017-07-17 13:03:41	lwang_	aris, the only overlap ones will likely come this week
2017-07-17 13:04:04	lwang_	herton, ^^ Lauro and Waiman are cherry picking the -stable tree
