2017-07-03 17:14:57	rostedt	bmeneg: I would just develop against Linus's mainline (that's what I do)
2017-07-03 17:15:15	rostedt	next is used to integrate all the development together, to see if one breaks the other
2017-07-03 17:15:23	bmeneg	rostedt: I get it. and based on the "next has others bug" I supose it's really valid
2017-07-03 17:16:58	bmeneg	rostedt: right. but the right way would be to find the subsystem maintainer's tree I would like to work with and build against it, correct?
2017-07-03 17:17:19	rostedt	yes, that is the best
2017-07-03 17:17:42	rostedt	you want to build against the tree owned by the maintainer you plan to send patches to

2017-07-03 17:27:47	rostedt	ug, I see the .txt has been removed
2017-07-03 17:27:50	bmeneg	gregkh: and because of that I was a bit lost, one doc mentions the linus tree.. other the staging and others next.. :)
2017-07-03 17:28:08	bmeneg	gregkh: but you are right, I'll take a closer look on the doc you said
2017-07-03 17:28:17	rostedt	still text readable
2017-07-03 17:29:39	bmeneg	rostedt: yes :) it seems all doc are being transalated to .rst which allows better structured docs

2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:08:12] peterz: Hi, I was the one who asked the confused question about stop_machine, thanks for having a look. I CCed you late when I thought you might have some insight. Your conclusion was "Using stop_machine() is per definition doing it wrong".
2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:08:42] Here's the issue I was/am trying to deal with: the HW I'm dealing with has a bad quirk
2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:09:08] it multiplexes PCI config space and mem space
2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:10:29] Sooo, these two types of accesses race, and since PCI mem accesses can occur anywhere, well bad things may occur at random basically
2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:11:58] The (nuclear) option would have been to "freeze" all processors before issuing a PCI config space access, and mark suggested stop_machine() for that
2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:13:22] hmmm, I realize I don't know which timezone you're on, and I may be monologing in the night :-)  I'll reply on the ML then
2017-07-04 09:26:03	peterz	[07:28:49] maze385: arghhh.. bad hardware is.. well.. bad 
2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:29:11] peterz: I had a chat with the designer ... sitting across my desk
2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:29:32] it's not often that I'm that close to the ... bungler
2017-07-04 09:26:03	maze385	[07:30:49] the issue should be fixed in the next chip, but given the latency of chip design... this could be 3 months or 2 years

2017-07-04 09:40:16	karg_	I am working on creating a patch as directed on the official website ,my doubt is that after I have built the kernel's repository and installed its modules so do I have to also run this kernel on my system on rebooting or can I be working on other versions of kernel which is my native version?

2017-07-04 10:10:54	maze385	peterz: suppose a thread masks interrupts locally (on the current core) ... if I want to take control of that core, I send an interrupt which will be masked until the thread exits its critical section?

2017-07-04 10:15:02	maze385	anyway, I tried summarizing exactly what I'm trying to accomplish in the email I just sent... There might be no solution which is acceptable upstream ... which would mean I would have to maintain this driver out-of-tree forever, bleh.

2017-07-05 09:19:24	snkcld	[21:15:57] is brk still a thing nowadays? i thought that like, the segmentation stuff wasnt used? i assumed that the segment registers just gave the entire address space to the segments or whatever
2017-07-05 09:19:24	snkcld	[21:16:28] or is it still used so that the heap doesnt collide
2017-07-05 09:19:24	snkcld	[21:17:38] with the stack
2017-07-05 09:19:24	DrNick	[21:27:38] brk doesn't have anything to do with segmentation
2017-07-05 09:19:24	snkcld	[21:54:06] oh
2017-07-05 09:19:24	snkcld	[21:54:22] i was thinking that like, brk was called to increase the length of your segment?

2017-07-05 09:19:24	abelvesa	[07:58:39] quick question about micro-optimisation:
2017-07-05 09:19:24	abelvesa	[07:59:18] is there any architecture outthere that can do cmp+jmp combined instructions in a single cycle?
2017-07-05 09:19:24	abelvesa	[08:00:25] I did bet on the fact that is impossible and I wanna know if there is a chance for me to lose :-)
2017-07-05 09:19:24	abelvesa	[08:01:34] my logic is as follows: if the cmp fails the pipeline gets dumped and jmp is/is not done, but it depends on the output of cmp
2017-07-05 09:19:24	tajnyman	[09:18:46] abelvesa: branch prediction in e.g. ARM can attempt to predict the result of conditional execution when deciding which instructions to prefetch to the pipeline. If it mispredicts the result, then of course, the pipeline must be flushed. See http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0363e/Cihfjigh.html

2017-07-05 09:29:43	tajnyman	In fact, in the ARMv8 Instruction Set Overview document, explains the absence of conditional execution in general (a staple in prior ARM architecture generations) by stating that benchmarking shows that modern branch predictors work well enough that predicted execution of (abritrary) instructions does not offer sufficient benefit to justify their siginicant use of the opcode space. See Sec 3.2. on p. 10 here ...

2017-07-06 10:05:04	gregkh	[08:08:43] qeni: what hardware do you have that has rs-485 support?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	ukleinek	[08:12:11] qeni: there is no general config for rs485. It comes for free in the serial core. Your UART driver has to support it though.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	qeni	[08:22:41] ukleinek & gregkh: I've got NanoPi M1+ and I need to get it working with rs-485

2017-07-06 10:05:04	qeni	[08:24:56] gregkh: to be honest I'm not sure, it's not related so much with what I do usually. I canot find anything about this in documentation of NanoPi
2017-07-06 10:05:04	jelly1	[08:25:21] I thought it was just serial
2017-07-06 10:05:04	gregkh	[08:25:22] qeni: then odds are, it doesn't.  does it have a serial port output with a real uart?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	jelly1	[08:26:31] qeni: the nanopi-m1 has serial pins on the PCB itself
2017-07-06 10:05:04	gregkh	[08:26:49] jelly1: what is the uart for it?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	 *	gregkh [08:27:06] places bets on something on the SoC that is bare-bones...
2017-07-06 10:05:04	jelly1	[08:27:24] gregkh: well the uart is for debugging
2017-07-06 10:05:04	gregkh	[08:27:42] jelly1: heh, then no way that supports 485 :)
2017-07-06 10:05:04	jelly1	[08:28:00] oh sure, I didn't imply that ;-0
2017-07-06 10:05:04	gregkh	[08:28:13] qeni: I suggest pushing back on whomever gave you that impossible task and tell them they need to give you hardware that actually works :)
2017-07-06 10:05:04	qeni	[08:33:52] lol. Actually we've got nanopi + usb-serial adapter + driver and it works, we're trying to make it cheaper. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/serial/serial-rs485.txt says that it's possible though
2017-07-06 10:05:04	karg_	[09:23:28] koike: i am currently going through orielly lld 3 book ,is it recommended to go through the entire book before attempting at the todo tasks in the source tree?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:25:41] hi
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:27:38] I would like to ask a "translation" from journalctl output to my understanding. I just has some freeze and forced reboot with SysRq, then difficulties to keep a tty opened while lightdm was trying to take on and bring me back automatically to the gui login, and I did an output with journalctl -r : someone can tell me what is wrong with my machine? http://pastebin.fr/50330
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:27:47] maybe that would help me fix it. :)
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:28:26] my kernel is 4.4.0-83-generic
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:28:49] with Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:29:30] this is obviously kernel messages, so I thought I would ask here where there are people who know things about kernels.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:33:52] something is holding a mutex and has not released it
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:34:59] but it's a really old kernel so no one is going to investigate except ubuntu folk
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:35:10] hi error27 
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:35:37] I get that, so I've gone also to the ubuntu-bugs chan. What is a "mutex" ? (if that's not too complex to explain)
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:36:08] which kernel do you use and with which distribution?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:37:17] is "mutex" to "mute x" ?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:37:53] no.  it's just a type of lock.  someone forgot to call unlock_mutex().  it's a common type of bug.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:38:34] btw, in bug reports i like to see a few lines from the dmesg where the kernel was working OK.  otherwise I always worry that I'm missing some context.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:39:37] oh? Let me paste one
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:41:46] I have one in /var/log which is very old, february 2016, and one from now which has errors from the kernel in it
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:42:30] the old one, if of any use http://pastebin.fr/50331
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:42:32] melodie_: i bet ubuntu has a latest kernel .deb hiding somewhere on their website.  if you ran that then you could complain to Sudip Mukherjee <sudipm.mukherjee@gmail.com> and devel@driverdev.osuosl.org
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:42:58] melodie_: yeah...  the old one isn't going to help. :/
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:43:20] and the one from now http://pastebin.fr/50332
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:45:40] error27, I ask the #ubuntu-kernel chan to point me to the latest available kernel
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:45:57] i was wrong before...  the locking is trivial and obviously correct.  there is just a hang somewhere so the first ioctl command doesn't return so that's why it doesn't get unlocked.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:47:17] I do have a printer which is connected to the machine, a HP that's old and whose scanner is dead. is it possible it sends wrong messages to the system, triggering the issue?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:48:24] it shouldn't hang, but yes, that's possible.  it should handle hardware failure more gracefully and just print an error message.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:49:27] will a kernel 4.12 be ok? That's what I'm pointed to at the ubuntu-kernel chan
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:49:57] yeah.  that's ideal
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:50:26] great, so let's do it! As they say! 
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:50:28] :D
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:51:33] http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.12/
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:54:43] i gotta be honest with you, we both agree that it's the failing printer causing this problem.  it's going to be hard for anyone to reproduce or fix.
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:54:55] s/agree/suspect/
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:55:16] do you know how to write c code?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:55:26] I don't
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:55:37] I have not learned coding so far
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[09:55:38] just to add print statements and re-compile the kernel
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:56:44] even if I knew it would be too much work for a printer which is going to finish the cartridges and then go to waste. I am now using one with scanning working only and the other with printing only. 
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:56:51] so next they'll be replaced
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:57:10] I look forward to buying a Epson EcoTank model 4550
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:57:43] about the newer kernel a problem could arise with the compiling of the nvidia blog, says the man who helps me on the ubuntu kernel chan
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[09:59:52] error27, thanks for all your insights! :)
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[10:03:11] hold up.  try this as root: `echo l > /proc/sysrq-trigger`
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[10:03:41] what is the purpose?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[10:03:59] that might show you where the printer got hung.  in your dmesg
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[10:04:19] ok!
2017-07-06 10:05:04	melodie_	[10:04:39] without the quotes?
2017-07-06 10:05:04	error27	[10:05:00] melodie_: everyone always blames the nvidia module as a default reflex but i have suppressed my instincts because i'm a creature of a higher order than that

2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[05:50:16] I'm looking at some code which uses rdtscpll() to get "current usec" used for benchmarking. It's (rightfully) removed upstream in 9261e050b686, with the reasoning "we fully support systems that don't have a TSC", so, what do I use instead to get usec for benchmarking?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	peterz	[05:52:15] rdtsc*() never gave usecs
2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[05:53:38] It was (perhaps incorrectly) divided with TSCHZ
2017-07-07 09:24:52	peterz	[05:54:12] in any case, if you know your machine is 'good' you can use sched_clock() which should give you nsecs
2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[05:54:45] what's the definition of a good machine?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	peterz	[05:55:09] one where TSC 'works', as in, it is synchronized across all CPUs
2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[05:55:24] It's an x86 machine
2017-07-07 09:24:52	peterz	[05:55:34] yes, for having tsc that needs be true
2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[05:55:50] right
2017-07-07 09:24:52	peterz	[05:55:53] but there are many broken x86 machines that never the less have the rdtsc instruction
2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[05:56:45] but if sched_clock() relies on TSC it should work just as good as rdtsc()?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	peterz	[05:56:52] yes
2017-07-07 09:24:52	peterz	[05:57:08] its rdtsc + mult + shift
2017-07-07 09:24:52	peterz	[05:58:02] see arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c:native_sched_clock() and cycles_2_ns()
2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[05:58:39] thanks peterz

2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[07:55:14] Hello. I'm hitting a nasty bug in 4.9.30 (debian stretch default kernel package), described in https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=866055 . Basically, one CPU core locks up that bad that the machine freezes, and even watchdog can't reset the machine anymore. I've added log_buf_len=32M debug to the kernel cmdline and remounted /var/log as sync, but absolutely nothing useful is shown at al
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[07:55:20] l.
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[07:55:51] What would be the best way to further debug this? I'm not all that well-known with kernel debugging (especially not at the level that this appears to be playing).
2017-07-07 09:24:52	damjan	[07:58:34] Alver: first I'd make sure the BIOS is up-to-date and intel ucode is installed
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:03:02] damjan: it's a VMware virtual machine in my case
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:03:15] (which is how I know it's locking one CPU core at 100% when it happens)
2017-07-07 09:24:52	damjan	[08:03:52] then it's probably not related to that bug
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:04:20] How do you figure?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:05:25] Well, regardless of whether it's related or not, I'd like to be able to debug it further - if something is bad enough to prevent even a watchdog from working, I can't trust it to run my services after all
2017-07-07 09:24:52	damjan	[08:08:55] Alver: I'd search for VMware related issues
2017-07-07 09:24:52	damjan	[08:09:13] otherwise make sure to enable all debuging
2017-07-07 09:24:52	damjan	[08:09:52] I have no experience with VMWare at all. if you can't see the debug info on the screen when the issue happens, then enable a "serial" console and send debug output to it, and log that on the host side
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:12:11] damjan: the thing is that the symptoms are the same as what happens on physical machines
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:12:19] (granted, the symptoms are rather vague)
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:13:23] There's no debug info being printed to the screen at the time of the occurance (I can see that on the VM console)
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:14:02] My main question was whether there is a way to enable more debugging at all, since my approach is giving me any additional info
2017-07-07 09:24:52	Alver	[08:17:08] ... *not* giving me. Ugh.
2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[08:42:04] can I do down_interruptible() on the write site of a rw_semaphore?
2017-07-07 09:24:52	rical_	[08:54:57] Found down_write_killable()

2017-07-07 14:39:24	stefan00	valdis: I got the book :) . IN_MODIFY triggers if a file WAS modified. What I long for is a way to get notified when a file was opened for writing - not actually modified (which would be later)
2017-07-07 14:46:54	valdis	stefan00: No, I don't think it works that way.  inotify was created for stuff like backup software and life-cycle management systems that handle tiering of files - they don't care if it was *opened* for write but then closed without an actual write hapening. They *do* care if the object was modified.
2017-07-07 14:47:28	valdis	What problem are you trying to solve by using inotify to be notified of "file opened for write"?

2017-07-07 15:11:49	stefan00	actually I work on some simple versioning / backup stuff. Since most files are rarely changed, I dont want to keep copies of every unchanged file. The idea is easy: clone a file only before it gets written to. So I actually need to 1) hook into the fs write or 2) copy the file before it gets actually written.

2017-07-07 15:58:08	snkcld	gregkh: ah, thank you. i brought this up because i became confused as to why /usr/lib/kernel/ installed on my system at all, but i just realized it was brought in from systemd, as systemd has some "kernel-install" file which uses it... so im just going to ignore it and make the initrd myself
2017-07-07 16:00:15	snkcld	my dracut and "make install" are all working perfectly fine. i was just wondering about the integration between "make install" automatically triggering the generation of the initrd
2017-07-07 16:00:53	snkcld	on my ubuntu, "make install" automatically makes the initrd. on my gentoo, i manually do it. i prefer gentoo's way, but i just wanted to make sure i understood the differences correctly

2017-07-10 09:25:26	jim	[17:03:59] hi... can someone explain what this means: http://termbin.com/o08g
2017-07-10 09:25:26	AlisonChaiken	[18:09:02] jim that looks quite puzzling.   Could you log in and look at dmesg?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	egnfrm	[18:15:10] @jim paging errors? http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/mm/debug.c#L52
2017-07-10 09:25:26	egnfrm	[18:17:57] should be other relevant entries in `dmesg` alongside those 
2017-07-10 09:25:26	jim	[19:12:39] egnfrmwould it work to pastebin the whole output of dmesg?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	jim	[19:15:14] as a plain user I'm getting (the unusual response of) operation not permitted...
2017-07-10 09:25:26	jim	[19:15:33] so I logged in as root, got it, this should be it: egnfrm
2017-07-10 09:25:26	jim	[19:15:42] oops one sec
2017-07-10 09:25:26	jim	[19:16:07] http://termbin.com/6f39
2017-07-10 09:25:26	egnfrm	[19:21:00] thats not so uncommon, sometimes non-root access to dmesg might impact security
2017-07-10 09:25:26	egnfrm	[19:22:04] if you manage that system you can always set kernel.dmesg_restrict=0 with sysctl
2017-07-10 09:25:26	FluffyFoxeh	[19:26:29] yeah you need to use root or change that sysctl if your kernel has CONFIG_SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT, which is now the default in Debian 
2017-07-10 09:25:26	FluffyFoxeh	[19:26:48] I don't use it. It's a pain. 
2017-07-10 09:25:26	egnfrm	[19:53:45] @jim don't know too much about mm, but i think the situation is something like this: 
2017-07-10 09:25:26	egnfrm	[19:55:03] kernel tries to unmap FF's memory; page corresponding to memory is already freed somehow? or maybe page table entries corrupted?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	egnfrm	[20:00:12] looks like you were swapping there too
2017-07-10 09:25:26	jim	[22:00:00] ff? you mean firefox?yep, I got -lots- of firefox tabs, and a few windows to put em in
2017-07-10 09:25:26	AlisonChaiken	[02:02:20] jim I've never, ever seen errors from swap device before: that is bizarre. 
2017-07-10 09:25:26	AlisonChaiken	[02:03:03] I'd guess Firefox crashed and managed to scribble all over swap.

2017-07-10 09:25:26	happy_hacker	[21:25:16] on peter the boot line is: BOOT_IMAGE=/vmlinuz-4.1.41 rootfstype=xfs root=/dev/sda2
2017-07-10 09:25:26	happy_hacker	[21:25:40] iirc this is done by udev (perhaps eudev here)
2017-07-10 09:25:26	happy_hacker	[21:27:43] using eudev (rather than udev) and OpenRC (not systemd), if that matters; probably does
2017-07-10 09:25:26	snkcld	[21:29:45] happy_hacker: im on gentoo, and i dont have /dev/root
2017-07-10 09:25:26	snkcld	[21:30:06] i use dracut with the vanilla kernel, fwiw. perhaps you use the gentoo-sources?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	happy_hacker	[21:56:07] snkcld: no, I only use kernel.org sources
2017-07-10 09:25:26	happy_hacker	[21:56:12] are you using systemd?
2017-07-10 09:25:26	happy_hacker	[21:56:24] because it does fuzzy things
2017-07-10 09:25:26	happy_hacker	[21:57:03] router is the only Gentoo box I have left; the rest are all Funtoo
2017-07-10 09:25:26	happy_hacker	[21:57:11] 6 or more
2017-07-10 09:25:26	snkcld	[22:06:57] happy_hacker: yea im using systemd
2017-07-10 09:25:26	snkcld	[22:07:13] im also using kernel.org to install. strange
2017-07-10 09:25:26	snkcld	[22:07:25] i assume this has more to do with the initramfs though
2017-07-10 09:25:26	snkcld	[22:07:56] happy_hacker: can you grep /etc/udev/rules.d, and find any occurence of SYMLINK+ ?

2017-07-10 11:50:04	bmeneg	hey folks, is there a specific IRC channel related to x86 architecture stuff? like its assembly language? or I could try ask it here? :)
2017-07-10 11:50:41	vbabka	you could
2017-07-10 11:51:15	bmeneg	vbabka: ok then :)
2017-07-10 11:54:43	bmeneg	I was trying to learn about x86-64 internals before dive onto others subjects, and when learning its assembly language (instruction format specifically) some questions appeared, for now I'll ask just one
2017-07-10 11:56:54	bmeneg	'movl   $0x0,-0x4(%rbp)' is a normal x64 mov long instruction, right, but the doubt is.. the opcode used to this MOV was c7, which seems to be "MOV r/m32, imm32" (based on the intel's sdm)
2017-07-10 11:57:26	-->	aconole (~user@nat-pool-bos-t.redhat.com) has joined #kernelnewbies
2017-07-10 11:57:47	bmeneg	why wasn't used a "REX.W c7" opcode? since I'm using on 64bits system?
2017-07-10 11:58:27	bmeneg	btw, the objdump for this instruction "c7 45 fc 00 00 00 00    movl   $0x0,-0x4(%rbp)"
2017-07-10 12:00:13	vbabka	http://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding#REX_prefix
2017-07-10 12:00:29	bmeneg	"REX.W c7" = "MOV r/m64, imm32".. and when dealing with the stack ("-0x4(%rbp)").. it should be handled as m64, doesn't it?
2017-07-10 12:00:31	vbabka	Instructions that default to 64-bit operand size in long mode are: ... MOV...
2017-07-10 12:01:28	vbabka	hm no, that's mov cr/mov dr
2017-07-10 12:06:26	vbabka	but in that table above you see that in long mode default address size is 64bit
2017-07-10 12:06:42	vbabka	and -0x4(%rbp) is address
2017-07-10 12:07:04	vbabka	for the immediate 0, it doesn't matter as it expands
2017-07-10 12:07:36	vbabka	well I'm not an expert
2017-07-10 12:08:58	bmeneg	vbabka: hmmm
2017-07-10 12:10:22	bmeneg	vbabka: in the table there is only mov cr/dr
2017-07-10 12:10:48	vbabka	see the Operand-size and address-size override prefix table

2017-07-10 12:13:07	vbabka	yeah that
2017-07-10 12:13:30	bmeneg	vbabka: the idea is that REX.W is used with 64b operands! and not addresses

2017-07-10 12:16:47	bmeneg	it seems to be opposite of that osdev-wiki table
2017-07-10 12:17:56	vbabka	weird

2017-07-10 12:37:15	karg_	But the email is same
2017-07-10 12:38:34	bmeneg	vbabka: opcode 8b MOV also has the same behavior.. from intel's sdm it is a "mov from r/m32 to r32" and in this point I partially agree, since %eax is a r32, but when dealing with stack, shouldn't it be handled as 64b always? since it's alignment is 64b
2017-07-10 12:39:13	gregkh	karg_: again, think about it, what would you do if you got a patch that looked like that?
2017-07-10 12:40:41	bmeneg	vbabka: it seems I missunderstood something about stack..

2017-07-10 14:18:01	bmeneg	vbabka: hey, I think I got the idea: MOVL is being used, so it forces 32b moves, ignoring real address length, and it is used because there isn't a real PUSH to the stack, RSP isn't being moved, so the address can be handled as any other length
2017-07-10 14:19:21	bmeneg	vbabka: the compiler just need to ensure that instructions over this peace of memory need to handle 32b values and not 64.. because of that every instruction after that movl is being used as "long instructions", 32b.
2017-07-10 14:22:59	bmeneg	the 64bits alignment is being forced thought that base-relative offsets -0x4, -0x8..

2017-07-10 16:27:00	valdis	Wild guessing by looking at the code around line 220, where you have 1: 2: 3: and knowing that in asm, the majority of jumps are either backwards to a very near label, or forward only 1-2 opcodes.

2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:07:35] Been a long time since I did C coding.  Working on common clock kernel driver. Trying to consume a clock, and devm_clk_get is returning an error (IS_ERR returns true).  I use PTR_ERR to convert the pointer error.  Now where do I find the err definitions to figure out what the error is?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:08:34] I see include/linux/clk.h includes <linux/err.h>.  And include/linux/err.h includes <asm/errno.h>.  Where would I find that file?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	sarnold	[20:24:53] Xiard: the moreutils package on debian/ubuntu provides an 'errno' utility that can return text descriptions for error numbers
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:30:13] Thanks.  I'll check it out.  But I should also be able to find precisely where the error codes are defined somewhere in the header files for the kernel, right?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:30:31] The <asm/errno.h> is throwing me off.  I can't remember how to figure out where in the path "<asm>" is.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	sarnold	[20:33:57] I think that turns into include/uapi/asm-generic/errno.h
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:43:45] Any idea how to figure that out...or how I would know to look in that file?  Still struggling to figure out how kernel development is documented.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:45:08] Or are errors defined consistently enough so that if I get an error code of 517, I can assume that if I can find any define of an error code with that numerical value, then I can assume that's the error I got?
2017-07-11 09:14:38	sarnold	[20:45:49] I've never seen one as high as 517, I'd expect that to be fairly specific to whatever section of code you're reading
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:55:38] Makes sense.  I just don't know how to figure out what it means, and how to traverse the chain of include paths to figure out where to look.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:55:49] I could guess, but that seems way to random for comfort.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	sarnold	[20:57:15] hopefully whatever actually returns values uses the EPERM or similar macros, then you can search with ctags or cscope or ripgrep
2017-07-11 09:14:38	sarnold	[20:57:20] or git grep
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:59:16] I played around with cscope...but am I searching for 517, the code?  Am I grepping for 517?  I suppose I could.
2017-07-11 09:14:38	Xiard	[20:59:47] I don't know what EPERM is.  I guess I can search for the source code for the function I'm calling and see what it can tell me.  
2017-07-11 09:14:38	flav	[04:45:20] Hi ! I am looking for documentation on the cgroup implementation

2017-07-11 09:14:38	dupondje	[04:49:27] gregkh: Small question. I don't see the following patch (https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=dfa523ae9f2542bee4cddaea37b3be3e157f6e6b) on the list to get backported to LTS kernels (like 4.9.x). Something I can do to make that happen? :) Cause the commit message might not look as its important, but it causes hangs/crashes on Xen hosts.. So a 
2017-07-11 09:14:38	dupondje	[04:49:33] good-to-have patch in my opinion ;)
2017-07-11 09:14:38	ukleinek	[05:12:53] dupondje: the protocol asks you to send this patch to stable@vger.kernel.org
2017-07-11 09:14:38	error27	[05:25:04] the patch went directly through davem's networking tree.  he handles all networking backports himself and gets annoyed if anyone goes around him and backports it directly.

2017-07-12 09:42:52	Reno	[22:35:06] Hi I have quick question. I remember reading somewhere in the kernel dev howto docs that you should tell the community that you are working on something before you begin. I want to add some features for an iio driver and I was wondering what the right way would be to go about telling the iio developers that I am doing this. Should I just send an email to the mailing list? The irc for iio seems pretty dead so that didn't seem like a good option.
2017-07-12 09:42:52	Benniee	[22:58:06] Interested to hear some thoughts from the experienced people in here on making changes to printk() calls when looking at code cleanups. I'm looking at a driver and all of the calls are "plain" printk(). I've done a little reading on replacing them with subsystem specific calls, or dev_ calls, or pr_ calls,however there is some commentary around that these type of patches don't offer a lot to the code. Is this something I should look at or are 
2017-07-12 09:42:52	Benniee	[22:58:06] cleanup efforts best spent elsewhere?

2017-07-12 14:41:12	philipp64	hi... somewhat tangential question, but I got a replacement .eep file for i82574L firmware... and I don't know what to do with it.  anyone have a link to either a linux tool for burning this file type to eeprom, or even a description of the file format so I can write a Perl-wrapper for ethtool?  thanks.
2017-07-12 14:41:58	philipp64	also, does the new linux firmware subsystem even handle NIC EEPROM firmware?

2017-07-12 16:14:01	valdis	philipp64: If it's an honest-to-goodness old-school EEPROM, you;ll need the appropriate burner hardware.
2017-07-12 16:14:30	valdis	philipp64: More likely these days it's actually flash memory.
2017-07-12 16:15:21	philipp64	I was going to use ethtool since it's for an i82574L NIC, but it's not a format that ethtool understands natively so I'll need to convert it if I can grok the source format...

2017-07-12 16:45:52	 *	jedix grumbles a bit
2017-07-12 16:48:51	jedix	What's the point of this? http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/ipc/sem.c#L308
2017-07-12 16:49:11	jedix	spin_lock followed by spin_unlock?
2017-07-12 16:49:31	jedix	it's like what I'm required to do before bed to the front door.. but why?
2017-07-12 16:49:47	jedix	wait, I unlock then lock.
2017-07-12 16:50:26	ukleinek	jedix: this asserts that after the spin_unlock all critical sections see sma->use_global_lock = USE_GLOBAL_LOCK_HYSTERESIS;
2017-07-12 16:51:00	jedix	ah, so it's an optimized barrier of sorts?
2017-07-12 16:52:00	jedix	thanks ukleinek

2017-07-14 10:02:07	marmistrz	[05:09:33] Hi! I have a gut feeling I have found a bug in ptrace. There's a lot of magic happening out there and I can't seem to find any other explanation
2017-07-14 10:02:07	marmistrz	[05:10:00] before I raise a bug on the kernel bugzilla, could anyone of you take a look if there's no bug in my code? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45082408/if-the-python-executable-is-specified-via-env-ptrace-smashes-stack
2017-07-14 10:02:07	marmistrz	[05:10:31] (at first I posted it on stackoverflow but the more I dwell on it, the more convinced I am that there's something broken with ptrace)
2017-07-14 10:02:07	tiny	[05:20:26] Hello. Is there a way to monitor if certain userspace process is running and get notified in immediately after it crashes/exits?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	tiny	[05:22:01] I was thinking about inotify monitoring /proc/PID but I don't think this will work since /proc aren't really files.

2017-07-14 11:04:48	koike	ah, ok, thanks :)
2017-07-14 11:04:57	derRichard	but only when in "folder" are modules and these are enabled
2017-07-14 11:07:05	julia_c	otherwise, you can just pass a directory to the kernel build system: make drivers/misc/ should build all modules in drivers/misc/ (note: you need the trailing '/')
2017-07-14 11:07:17	julia_c	in your case: make W=2 drivers/misc/, or whatever.

2017-07-17 09:55:25	sherlock	[04:54:39] I believe those symbols are coming from libcore (which I compile for target arch). The library is a freestanding one and exports those as weak symbols
2017-07-17 09:55:25	sherlock	[04:55:35] Better I ask, how can I map those exported ones to kernel symbols?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	valdis	[05:46:55] sherlock: Better question would be:  "How do I learn to properly code inside the kernel, where there's no glibc?"
2017-07-17 09:55:25	rw-r-r_0644	[05:54:57] Hi, I'm trying to port linux to an embedded ppc platform but ioremap keeps crashing because it tries to map addresses to already mapped memory; is there some config to set ioremap base address?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	sysplex	[17:54:29] hi
2017-07-17 09:55:25	sysplex	[17:55:20] i've got a question: inet/ipv4/tcp_output.c:2950
2017-07-17 09:55:25	sysplex	[17:55:25] what is this c syntax called? what keyword do I need to google?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	DrNick	[17:57:23] that's called a macro
2017-07-17 09:55:25	sysplex	[18:02:02] okay, the code looks really strange.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	sysplex	[18:02:02] it seems to resolve to a for loop
2017-07-17 09:55:25	sysplex	[18:05:42] thats the problems with macros in any language, you can totally change the look/meaning of the language. what seems to be some clever abbrevation is totally unreadable be everyone else.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	vbabka	[18:09:02] yes, e.g. thanks to rostedt, you can enable a config option that redefines "if"
2017-07-17 09:55:25	spear2	[00:04:38] what does NvRm stand for? (nvidia driver)
2017-07-17 09:55:25	spear2	[00:24:38] an i think i figured it out: "NVIDIA Resource Manager"
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:18:18] should I favor mutexes or spinlocks in genral code?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:20:41] depends on the context and how long you sleep
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:20:46] *lock
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:22:26] using it in a filesystem driver to ensure internal state consistency
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:23:00] my answer remains the same
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:23:01] I don't do any I/O while holding my locks, and I generally only hold them for a few lines
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:23:16] if you can sleep and you might hold the lock longer --> mutex
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:24:00] rule of thumb for spinlocks, only hold it for a few lines of code :D
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:24:02] the longest I hold my locks is at initialization
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:24:42] the reason I ask
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:24:55] is I have one for managing parts of the block bitmap
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:25:44] and the ext2 code uses spinlocks when setting bits
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:25:52] yes, this makes sense
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:27:11] maybe I should use a rwlock...
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:28:33] why?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:28:59] don't use fancy locking unless you need to
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:29:37] well, most of the time the pattern is
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:30:34] search_for_free_block(); if(!try_allocate_block()) { goto search; }
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:30:58] do you face lock contention?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:31:07] what do you mean?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:31:15] lock contention
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:31:39] don't use fancy locking without a reason and based on guesswork
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:31:44] ok
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:31:59] in most cases spinlocks and mutexes are perfectly fine
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:32:24] the other use case
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:32:47] is making sure we have an accurate count of the free blocks
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:33:57] I just don't know what the point is where one is more efficeient than the other
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:34:02] *efficient
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:38:35] man this stuff makes my brain hurt
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:41:34] ok, second question: my bitmap structure looks like `struct bitmap { spinlock_t lock; uint32_t free; /* data */ };`
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:42:00] bitmap->lock protects both ->free and ->data
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:42:29] should I change ->free to atomic_t and just use ->lock for ->data?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[06:48:06] erm, we have a ready to use bitmap library in the kernel
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:51:00] derRichard: that appears just to be a library to manipulate bits in a bitmap
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:51:09] I have more information in this structure
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[06:51:16] and data isn't a flat buffer
2017-07-17 09:55:25	mjb2	[08:31:35] q
2017-07-17 09:55:25	rw-r-r_0644	[09:56:39] Does irq_domain_ops.alloc basically replace irq_domain_ops.map in hierarchical irq domains?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	gregkh	[10:10:15] Forty-Bot: atomics do not protect yourself from a lack of locking, don't make that mistake.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	whitecrow1	[12:34:54] So, I think, I should not ask my question!!!

2017-07-17 09:55:25	whitecrow1	[12:39:40] :)
2017-07-17 09:55:25	happy_hacker	[12:39:47] whitecrow1: just ask; worse that can happen is you get ignored
2017-07-17 09:55:25	happy_hacker	[12:40:21] do your research, state the problem, what you expect, what happened, etc as best you can
2017-07-17 09:55:25	happy_hacker	[12:40:35] pastebin logs if needed
2017-07-17 09:55:25	happy_hacker	[12:40:46] if someone can answer, the will
2017-07-17 09:55:25	happy_hacker	[12:41:18] the more challenging the question/problem, the higher probability of an actual kernel maintainer replying
2017-07-17 09:55:25	whitecrow1	[12:41:29] first thing first, please forgive me, i can't speak EN very will. so please be Patient
2017-07-17 09:55:25	happy_hacker	[12:41:41] NB: I am not; and don't highlight anyone unless they start dialoging with you
2017-07-17 09:55:25	whitecrow1	[12:42:26] :) okay.
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[12:47:47] wut?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[12:51:20] ...
2017-07-17 09:55:25	happy_hacker	[12:54:34] think long, think wrong "So, I think, I should not ask my question!!!"
2017-07-17 09:55:25	happy_hacker	[12:54:35] bam
2017-07-17 09:55:25	FluffyFoxeh	[13:55:44] gregkh: I thought the point of atomics is that you don't need locks to use them 
2017-07-17 09:55:25	gregkh	[13:57:43] FluffyFoxeh: depends on what you use them for and how you use them. 
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[00:34:19] gregkh: my problem here is that my data needs to be protected by a lock, but the metadata doesn't need to be precisely in-sync with the data
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[00:35:10] e.g. if a bitmap's is full but the free count hasn't been updated yet, the worst thing that happens is a few threads search it for free blocks which don't exist
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[00:37:01] so I don't know if I need to have the same lock for both the free count and the data itself
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[01:15:14] e.g. I could just implement ->free as atomic, and use atomic bitops to keep ->data in-sync
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[01:19:29] it appears this is what the ext2 code does on arm processors
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[01:20:16] but on other architectures it uses a spinlock for both setting bits and updating the free count
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[01:26:16] although curiously it appears to use spin_lock and not spin_lock_irq like the atomic bitops version
2017-07-17 09:55:25	Forty-Bot	[01:40:44] the real question is why ext2 has its own bitops
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:29:40] hello, i am trying to boot an armv7 Cortex a-9 with a 4.1.8 kernel 
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:29:48] after rootfs is mounted i am getting this Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! exitcode=0x00000004
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:30:22] i've tried using init=, as busybox, sh, dash, sysv init
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:30:31] pretty much everything leads to the same result,  
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:31:27] setting print-fatal-signals=1 on the bootcmd,  also throwsd this extra message "potentially unexpected fatal signal 4"
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:32:02] Using a precompiled rootfs provided by the devel board vendor, boots normally, using my built kernel + precompiled rootfs
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[07:42:46] 04 is SIGILL
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[07:42:57] your binary cannot run on this cpu/kernel
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:43:54] derRichard: that's what i thought as well
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:44:11] i copied the binary on a running system though and it seems to run fine :(
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:44:38] maybe my rootfs is missing libraries or something i'll recheck 
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[07:45:20] no, no library issue
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[07:45:31] you get SIGILL because the cpu instructions don't work
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:45:42] hmm that's weird, 
2017-07-17 09:55:25	derRichard	[07:45:52] wrong arm subarch? thumb support missing?
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:46:10] i tried thumb enabling/disabling didnt change a thing 
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:46:29] i also played around with floating point options since tthis cpu is "modular"
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:46:40] nothing worked, and the funniest part is this
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:46:50] using my kernel + vendor roofs, makes the system boot
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:47:04] then i copied over my compilation of busybox and it runs fine...
2017-07-17 09:55:25	apalos	[07:48:15] derRichard: juist the confirmation that it's something on arch/subarch helps though, thanks!

2017-07-17 12:10:36	jbgg	hi, I have a question about a problem when I compile the kernel. The build process stops at some point. The freezed process is 'bc -q kernel/time/timeconst.bc', when generates timeconst.h (in ./Kbuild file)
2017-07-17 12:11:55	jbgg	the exact execute command is: (echo 1000 | bc -q kernel/time/timeconst.bc) < kernel/time/timeconst.bc > include/generated/timeconst.h.tmp
2017-07-17 12:12:25	jbgg	I have test in the command line: echo 1000 | bc -q kernel/time/timeconst.bc, but freezed
2017-07-17 12:13:52	cdleonard	apalos: maybe the illegal instruction is executed by "busybox init" specifically but not "busybox sh". If you dig enough you might be able to get the address where SIGILL is generated and dump instructions
2017-07-17 12:15:07	jbgg	and if I execute: echo "1000\nquit" | bc -q kernel/time/timeconst.bc, it works fine
2017-07-17 12:15:54	jbgg	I have bc with version 1.07
2017-07-17 12:16:01	jbgg	any idea of this problem?

2017-07-17 12:42:01	gregkh	jbgg: that is very odd.  there is a newer version of bc out there, I see 1.07.1 here.
2017-07-17 12:43:53	jbgg	I got from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bc/
2017-07-17 12:44:11	jbgg	because https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/ link me to there
2017-07-17 12:44:23	jbgg	sorry
2017-07-17 12:44:43	jbgg	I didn't saw 1.07.1 version, I got the last one in order, sorry
2017-07-17 12:45:46	jaeckel	is there an easy way to print corrupt ethernet frames that are received by a usb-ethernet controller? I guess the driver would need support for that, right?
2017-07-17 12:47:26	jaeckel	oh, there is usbmon
2017-07-17 12:49:05	xayto	jaeckel: if there is a switch/router between the devices sending/recieving you wont see the bad frame more than likely
2017-07-17 12:49:10	jbgg	thank you gregkh, that solved the problem 
2017-07-17 12:49:49	jaeckel	xayto: that's why I connect them directly and yes they have support for Auto-MDIX
2017-07-17 12:51:44	xayto	cool :) just didnt want you scratching your head as the frames would be dropped completly before they goto to your device

2017-07-17 12:53:16	jaeckel	nah, I'm currently writing an ethernet driver for an embedded device, but I can't successfully send from it... my switch reports erroneous received frames from that port so I thought I could display them somehow
2017-07-17 12:54:41	jedix	wireshark?
2017-07-17 12:56:25	xayto	depends on what the device passes up
2017-07-17 12:56:52	xayto	if the CRC check fails on a frame its usually just dropped... no passing go, no collecting 200
2017-07-17 12:58:08	jedix	it doesn't make it to the wire?
2017-07-17 12:58:27	jedix	I'd hook the device directly to another machine running wireshark
2017-07-17 13:01:47	jaeckel	jedix: where does wireshark resp. libpcap exactly hook in?
2017-07-17 13:02:13	jaeckel	if it's after the mac driver you're lost if that one drops frames with corrupt CRC

2017-07-17 13:03:30	jedix	jaeckel: not sure, it enters promisc. mode which might help?
2017-07-17 13:03:51	jaeckel	already tried that
2017-07-17 13:05:06	xayto	if your writing the driver, can you try logging the frame your sending

2017-07-17 13:06:12	jaeckel	yeah sure, I know what I'm sending, but I'd like to see what is coming out on the other side of the cable :)
2017-07-17 13:06:42	jaeckel	but nvm, I'll put it back to the hardware guy, it's his problem now ;-)
