2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:33:27] ping swhiteho 
2017-07-04 09:26:02	swhiteho	[05:34:59] pong
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:35:08] good morning, swhiteho 
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:35:54] I have a support case involving Veritas mentioning high memory useage, was wondering if you could have a look at it to see if it is similar to what we dealt with a while ago
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:36:19] swhiteho, 01877533 
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:36:43] oh, sorry swhiteho , wrong case id
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:37:08] swhiteho, 01878035
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:38:30] swhiteho, "Analysis so far:
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:38:30]  * From vmcore we see that GAB panicked the system and from logs it looks like due to lack of memory. But we do not see memory pressure in the system. We asked customer to engage Veritas for further analysis from their side.
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:38:30]  * Veritas has provided some analyis(comment#4) and I am not sure if it is valid."
2017-07-04 09:26:02	swhiteho	[05:44:42] well, there is nothing obvious that I can see there
2017-07-04 09:26:02	swhiteho	[05:45:24] I'm not that familiar with the balloon driver, best ask the VM/virt team about that one, I can't tell from the details there whether it was actually being used or not
2017-07-04 09:26:02	swhiteho	[05:45:40] and I don't know its compatibility with Veritas either
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:46:12] swhiteho, ok, thanks, I thought the "out of memory but we don't see where it went" was similar to what we had seen back then
2017-07-04 09:26:02	swhiteho	[05:46:16] however if the customer was trying to do live migration of a cluster node, then I can see why that might well cause a problem
2017-07-04 09:26:02	swhiteho	[05:46:41] we don't support that with gfs2/rhel-ha for example
2017-07-04 09:26:02	pjakobs	[05:51:05] swhiteho, I'll leave it to the support folks then, thanks
2017-07-04 09:26:02	lkocman	[07:23:15] Hello guys!, we do need to to find a kernel SME for help with kernel errata documentation (7.3.z) errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/29274

2017-07-04 09:26:03	lkocman	[07:26:02] xhe, there is advisory which needs to be released today, and this is still a problem
2017-07-04 09:26:03	xhe	[07:26:19] lkocman, yes, I am. Let me check the bugs now
2017-07-04 09:26:03	lkocman	[07:26:23] and also this one https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466820
2017-07-04 09:26:03	lkocman	[07:26:25] xhe, ^
2017-07-04 09:26:03	lkocman	[07:26:59] xhe, you saved the day! lenka will ping you (lspackova)
2017-07-04 09:26:03	xhe	[07:28:58] lkocman, I will check which subteams they belongs to , and then forward to the subteam leaders later
2017-07-04 09:26:03	lkocman	[07:29:57] xhe, lenka actually said that they need just one bug
2017-07-04 09:26:03	lkocman	[07:30:05] xhe, she'll sync up with ya
2017-07-04 09:26:03	xhe	[07:32:37] lkocman, what's lspackova email? let me file email to kernel-qe@ and CC you and her

2017-07-06 11:09:57	lwoodman	I simplified another reproducer to demonstrate the cause. If I remove the printf, program works fine and return 0. With printf, libc mmaps 1 page vma right before the stack vma (within 1M guard gap), and cause SIGBUS.

2017-07-07 11:06:48	lwoodman	lwang: hmmm
2017-07-07 11:06:59	lwang	lwoodman, I believe that was the first kernel that it was reported
2017-07-07 11:07:08	lwang	lwoodman, but then there is the 7.3.z one too.. 
2017-07-07 11:07:24	lwang	lwoodman, before I asked him to reinstall and switch over to 7.3.z, I want to double chekc
2017-07-07 11:07:35	lwoodman	lwang: this is all very confusing
2017-07-07 11:08:33	lwoodman	lwang: maybe its some specific configuration that we dont have/use?
2017-07-07 11:08:52	lwang	lwoodman, asking CEE to open up that usecase

2017-07-07 14:40:46	jpoimboe	riel: the stack pointer moves from the stack vma to the data vma, with no page fault
2017-07-07 14:40:52	jpoimboe	riel: because there's no gap
2017-07-07 14:41:23	riel	jpoimboe, oh, so the mmap(...MAP_FIXED...) places the new VMA immediately below where the stack VMA is currently?
2017-07-07 14:41:31	jpoimboe	riel: right
2017-07-07 14:41:51	jpoimboe	riel: arch_get_unmapped_area() allows MAP_FIXED to do that
2017-07-07 14:42:02	jpoimboe	riel: it doesn't call vm_start_gap() for that case
2017-07-07 14:42:13	riel	which it should - we're not supposed to mess with MAP_FIXED
2017-07-07 14:46:10	jpoimboe	riel: but should it not shrink the stack so there's still a gap?
2017-07-07 14:46:51	riel	jpoimboe, not afaik
2017-07-07 14:46:55	jpoimboe	riel: that's apparently what it used to do, but maybe that was just an implementation quirk, since the gap was part of the stack VMA
2017-07-07 14:47:28	riel	jpoimboe, however, it should not grow the stack past that MAP_FIXED VMA - trying to use stack space below that MAP_FIXED VMA (assuming it is not also mapped) should segfault, instead of having the stack further extended
2017-07-07 14:48:09	jpoimboe	riel: makes sense
2017-07-07 14:48:50	jpoimboe	riel: ok, so it sounds like this test case is invalid, and MAP_FIXED is working as designed

2017-07-14 10:02:07	lwoodman	[09:40:07] jburke: but lot me try another target
2017-07-14 10:02:07	jburke	[09:40:36] lwoodman, let me get you the target to use 1 sec
2017-07-14 10:02:07	lwoodman	[09:41:14] jburke: trying rhel-5.10-candidate

2017-07-14 10:02:07	jburke	[09:44:40] lwoodman, Try RHEL-5.11-Z-test 
2017-07-14 10:02:07	jburke	[09:46:36] lwoodman, did that work?
2017-07-14 10:02:07	lwoodman	[09:46:53] jburke: trying it...
2017-07-14 10:02:07	lwoodman	[09:47:36] jburke: that seems to work, Thx Jeff!  :)

2017-07-14 13:56:53	vgoyal	ebiederm: so we don't allow setting file capabilities from inside user namespace because we think that an unprivileged user can launch a user namespace with root inside and set file capability and then come outside user namespace and gain that capability on host

2017-07-14 13:58:43	ebiederm	vgoyal, Because otherwise you could gain capabilities you don't have.

2017-07-14 14:23:19	vgoyal	ebiederm: i think tmpfs had to do something with it. I moved my binary to /usr/local/bin/ and it works now
2017-07-14 14:23:54	ebiederm	vgoyal, I can see that.  /tmp traditionally runs with some interesting permissions.
2017-07-14 14:24:01	vgoyal	-rwxr-xr-x. 1 vivek vivek 8592 Jul 14 13:21 capability
2017-07-14 14:24:18	vgoyal	capability = cap_net_raw+ep
2017-07-14 14:24:42	vgoyal	so now when I run this binary as user vivek, it prints it has cap_net_raw. cool.
2017-07-14 14:25:16	vgoyal	now atleast I understand the problem better of allowing setting file capabilities from inside user namespaces. And how a user can gain privileges due to this
2017-07-14 14:26:36	ebiederm	vgoyal, Cool.

2017-07-14 14:30:49	vgoyal	ebiederm: agreed. Atleast I want to review it from overlayfs point of view and container usage point of view in general
2017-07-14 14:31:09	vgoyal	ebiederm: want to make sure nested file systems will not be broken due to change of creds in lower layer
2017-07-14 14:31:15	vgoyal	s/nested/stacked
2017-07-14 14:31:25	vgoyal	yesterday tested it and it seemed to work
2017-07-14 14:31:32	ebiederm	vgoyal, Are you at all interested in getting overlayfs to be mounted as an user namespace root?
2017-07-14 14:31:44	vgoyal	because all the name determination of xattr was happening in upper layer using caller's user namespace
2017-07-14 14:32:00	ebiederm	vgoyal, Good point.
2017-07-14 14:32:38	vgoyal	ebiederm: so far container people have not bothered me to allow mounting overlayfs unprivileged. they seem to be ok with docker mounting it 
2017-07-14 14:32:40	ebiederm	vgoyal, That gets doubly interesting when s_user_ns gets takin into account.  
2017-07-14 14:32:51	vgoyal	ebiederm: but they keep pushing for shiftfs equivalent
2017-07-14 14:33:14	ebiederm	vgoyal, yes...
2017-07-14 14:33:39	vgoyal	ebiederm: upstream discussion on shiftfs seems to have died. not sure if james is still working on it or not
2017-07-14 14:34:42	ebiederm	vgoyal, That is the kind of thing that comes and goes.  And James has a lot of other things on his plate.

2017-07-17 13:25:26	dhoward	gummels: what's your q?
2017-07-17 13:26:17	gummels	dhoward Lets say a customer wants a z-stream that requires two commits that where each was pulled in via different bugs.
2017-07-17 13:26:38	gummels	dhoward i.e. there is no y-stream bug that covers both commits.
2017-07-17 13:26:49	gummels	dhoward I'm probably overthinking this
2017-07-17 13:27:15	dhoward	If both y bugs are straight-forward bugfixes, simply clone both
2017-07-17 13:27:46	gummels	dhoward ok that's what I was hoping you would say

2017-07-17 13:49:44	herton	ykaliuta, that's strange, do you reproduce with a stock 4.11.0-9.el7.ppc64le kernel? It seems some module didn't install or is missing, or something went wrong with /lib/modules/4.11.0-9.el7.ppc64le

2017-07-17 13:52:26	ykaliuta	something looks really wrong for me with the build

2017-07-17 13:53:12	herton	ykaliuta, that didn't show before or in kt1 testing, I guess there is something wrong with the system IBM tested. Try to get a powerpc system on beaker, see if it reproduces

2017-07-17 13:54:10	ykaliuta	I'll improve the script, but if there is real version mismatch, it is not bootable anyway

2017-07-17 13:55:05	herton	ykaliuta, my guess is some module didn't install (eg. lack of disk space), then later depmod fails because of obvious missing symbols

2017-07-17 13:55:23	herton	ykaliuta, that's why I say first we should see if really is a build issue or a system issue (try to reproduce it)
2017-07-17 13:56:22	ykaliuta	sure it makes sense
